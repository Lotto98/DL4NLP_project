{"seconds feed": 34620, "text": " Okay, does anyone want to see Steve's feedback from the specification? Is there much more in there than he said yesterday? Not really, just what he's talking about, like duplication of effort.  And yeah, maybe think about having a prototype for week six, which is naturally. So probably prioritize our. Yeah, I'd say if for the prototype, if it's just like wherever possible, chunking the stuff that we have pre annotators and stuff. And for the stuff that we don't have pre annotated right like a stupid baseline, then we  should probably be able to basically, that means we focus on the interface first sort of so that we take the ready-made parts and just see how we get them work together in the interface the way we want it. And then we have a working prototype and then we can go back and replace pieces either by our own components or by more sophisticated components of our own. So it's probably feasible. Things are a way this weekend. So that's what we need. If we just want to have some data for the  the user face could even be random data.  XML offers us and then just sort of everyone make sure everyone understand the interface So I think if today we decide on what data we want to have now and later maybe even today we go and look at night XML or some of us look at night XML in a bit more detail just trying to make some sense of that code and See how does the representation work in their system and then sort of with that knowledge we should be able to then say okay that top-flight XML data  We want to load into it and this is how everyone can access it and then We should be able to go to the Java code for now But look at the documentation and like seen enough to make me think that if you want to use the not XML framework because They have a good event model that synchronizes sort of the data and in every display element that takes a lot of work away from us Sort of that would be a reason for staying within their framework  using that general classes but beyond that I haven't looked at it at all. Which is something we should really do. Who actually like for this whole discussion I mean who of us is doing stuff that is happening online and who of us is doing stuff that's happening offline like my data is coming  The basic word importance is of mine as well. The combined measure might not be if we want to wait what the user has typed into the search. Okay. Mine is going to be mostly using the offline but the actual stuff is doing will be online. They won't be very processor intensive or memory intensive. So basically apart from the display module the display itself we don't have an extremely high degree of interaction between  sort of our modules that create this stuff and the interface. So the interface is mainly while it's running just working on data that's just loaded from a file, I guess. I don't know about research functionality that might be online, depends how it's going to work. Yeah, and the search is sort of a strange piece anyway because for the search we're leaving the Nintex-Melive framework. But that's still sort of that's good.  We don't have the type of situation where somebody has to do like a billion calculations on data online. Because that would make it a lot more like that would mean that our interface for the data would have to be a lot more careful about how it performs and everything and nobody is modifying that data. It online time, it all it seems. Nobody is making any changes to the actual data online. So that's actually making it a lot easier. That basically means our browser really is a viewer.  which isn't doing much with the data except for selecting a piece of fit and just playing it. Are we still gonna go for dumping it into a database? Are we still gonna dump it into a database? Well some parts relevant for the search, yes. I'd say so. Because if we are iraq and we should all read our classes out the database, it'll be so much easier. Well if we're gonna dump the part of the into a database anyway,  We might sort of dump all the fields we want into the database, calculate everything from there. So we don't even have to worry that much about the underlying XML representation. We can just query it. But nobody of us is doing much of searching from the data in the online stage. And for altogether, like the display itself, I think we are easier if we, if it's sitting on the XML, then if it's sitting on the SQL stuff, because if it's sitting on the XML, we have the, the night XML,  framework with all its functionality for synchronizing through all the different levels whenever there's a change and everything's moving forward and stuff and we can just more let's look at their code like how their player moves forward and how that moving forward is represented in different windows and stuff. So I think in the actual browser itself I don't want to sit on the SQL if you can sit on the XML because sitting on the XML we have so much help and for like the calculations that we're doing apart from the search  It seems to everyone need some special representations anyway. We're going to do that. We should run store everything in the XML format as well. You mean our results? Yeah. Yeah. In the night XML format, so with the timestamps and stuff, so that it's easy to tie together things here. What I'm like, what we have to think about is if we go with this multi-level idea, like this idea that sort of, if you start with the whole meetings here,  as one entity, as one thing that you display, as one whole sort of, that then the individual chunks are the individual meetings. Whereas, and then you can click on a meeting, and then sort of the meeting is the whole thing, and the chunks are the individual segments. That means sort of we have multiple levels of representation, which we probably, if we do it this way, like we have to discuss it, if we do it this way, then we should probably find some abstraction models,  that the interface in the sense like deals with it is if it's the same so that the interface doesn't really have to worry whether it's a meeting in the whole meeting series or a segment within a meeting you know what I mean? And there's probably stuff that we have to sort of like process twice then like for example that like the summary of a meeting within the whole meeting corpus or meeting series is meeting series a good word that I don't really know how to call it you know what I mean like not the whole corpus but every meeting that has to do with one topic  So in the meeting series that are summary for a meeting within the meeting series is sort of compiled offline by a summary module and that is separate from a summary of a segment within a meeting So don't think we can well we don't even need to do that because we got our information density calculated offline So all we do is treat the whole lot as one massive document I mean they'll it's not going to be so big we can't load in a information density for every usurance I mean just summarize  I thought we would just have like one big summary with only different importance levels displayed on it and depending on what our Zoom level is we just display a part of it. So are we doing that at all levels, are we? I mean we would have one very big thing offline and from that we would just select what we are displaying. And just have different like  So for example, you would give a high value to those sequences you want to display in the meeting series summary. So the only thing that would happen basically if I double click from the whole meeting series on a single meeting is that the zoom level changes like the start in the end position changes and the zoom level changes.  I was under the impression that we couldn't do that because we couldn't load the data for all that. But I don't know. I mean, I don't think there's really much pointing like that when it's just going to feed off in the end. The information density measure basically and that's all calculated offline. So all you're really doing is sorting a list. This is a computationally hard part of it. So I'm not sure if I got it. Well, like the idea is where  So  memory complexity of it. But I could really admit, I just sort of like took that from something that Jonathan once said about not loading everything, but maybe I was just wrong about it. And I think the difference might be that we would just want to have the words and that's not so much. What he meant was not possibly loading everything was. Yeah. You can load all the annotation stuff, all the sound files, all. So what we have is we would have  a word like we would have words with some priority levels and they would basically be it already because even the selection would the summaries automatically feed from just how prioritized an individual word or how any prioritized an individual after instance or other summary sort of refined from that and made by a machine to make sense and stuff or are they just sort of taking out the words of the highest priority and then the words of the second time on the options level is thinking and the options is  I mean, I think we have started an end time for words that clip it every single word. Yeah, but it might but it might sound crazy in the player We should really maybe we can do that together at some point today that we checked out how the player works. I don't think but there's maybe some merit in altogether doing it on that principle. I'm getting quite lost  the same thing.  in the latest draft that we had sort of we came up with the idea that it isn't displaying after-and-fart-frame split also displaying a summarized version in you know like below the graph the part yeah maybe yeah yeah it isn't that the skimming isn't that the skimming oh yeah it's just like the there's like audio skimming and there's just played skimming yeah but it's just same data yeah yeah maybe there's some  It might be better skimming and less memory required at the same time and if you know how to do it for individual words then you can just in the worst case if you can't find anything else just to make the mean of the words  over the utterance, you know what I mean? No, quite. So what did you want to do? You just wanted to assign... What's the smallest chunk at the moment you're thinking of assigning an importance measure to? Is it a word or is it an utterance? I thought about words. So we're thinking of like maybe just storing it on a part-run level. Because it's less stuff to store probably for Dave in the audio playing, and for in the display it's probably better if you have whole utterances than... I don't know like...  It's like if you just take single words out of our friends, it probably doesn't make any sense at all. If you just show important utterances, but the utterances are whole, it makes more sense. So it doesn't actually make a difference for your algorithm, because it just means that if you work on a word level, then we just mean it over there. Yeah, I think we also thought about combining that matter with the matter as I get from hotspots and so on. They are on. So that would also be on a transduper.  Anyway, I think that makes it a lot easier than to put it on our train to be calculated at word level though because otherwise there won't be enough occurrences as it turns to where you can hear any of it. Oh yeah, I mean like how, how just mean does it internally? I don't know but it's probably you probably have to work on word levels for importance but there should be ways of easily going from a word level to an utterance of how you can just read it. But how about those words which don't carry any meaning at all the um, and the urs and something like that?  Because if we average over a whole utterance, other words, and there are quite an important words in there, but quite important words as well. I think we should just disregard that. Maybe we should have like a cut off, so it would only get to value, it's above a certain threshold. So anything that has less than say 0.5 importance gets assigned  to zero.  Yeah, I think it would be very hard. I think it would be like an hour or two's work So what do you mean by buffering like you think director's feeding and another? Waifile essentially, yeah, but not but not store it on the heart just can load it in but load it indirectly from memory So just like there's bound to be like a media wave object or something like that and just but it's probably a dream if it exists in Java it would probably some binary stream going in sometime  like cars is for dealing with, it was a little bit as cars is for concatenating, and files you can do in memory. Okay, so that means that there's probably, even if you go on a preference level, there's still some merit on within utterances, cutting out stuff which clearly isn't relevant at all, and that may be also for the order we'd have to do. So let's say we play the whole phrase, but then in addition to that, we have some information that says, minus that part of something. That's okay that we can do. Oh, I think I might try and build this basically.  a class that you just feed it a linked list of different waveforms that will just string them all together with maybe 10 to the second silence in between each one or so. Yeah, maybe even I mean that's sort of that depends on how advanced we get. If maybe if you realize that there's massive differences in gain or in something you can probably just make some simple normalization but that really depends on how much time we have and how much necessary. Yeah, I don't know anything about Audion. I have never seen the player.  find that the player accepts some input from memory and if it's easy to do then I guess that's that's fairly doable. So that means that the general structure is actually quite lucky. So we have we load into memory for the whole series of meetings, just the utterances and rankings for the utterances and some information probably that says well I guess that goes for the utterance who's speaking? Oh yeah. Because then we can also do the display but who's speaking? We also really want to be able to search by who's speaking as well.  Yeah But I'm still confused because I thought like that's just what Jonathan said that we that we can't do like load massive Document of that size Yeah, because all the calculations done offline The other thing I mean it shouldn't like should be like 50 megabytes and Ram or something it shouldn't be massive actually 50 hundred megabytes quite big in room  Just thinking what's this sim? So we do get an error message with the project if you load everything into the project with all the data they load. So we know that doesn't work. So our hope is essentially that we load less into it. What's this lazy loading thing? Somebody explained lazy loading. It means it loads on demand. Only loads when it needs to secure  So that is that only by type of file. If the same thing is in different files, would it then maybe like, you know, if up trends is split over three or 10 or 100 different files, is then a chance movie that it doesn't try to load the model to memory at the same time, but just. Yeah, I think that's the idea. It just loads. What is it failed in the first place and it shouldn't ever fail because then it should never. But if you didn't search over the whole corpus, you talked about the model.  Yeah, but it failed right when you load it right the nice X-mail kit. That's interesting. So just a different baseline, loaded loads. For example, it loads all the addresses and so on, but it doesn't load the just cause acts and for example not the, what else was there, not the summaries.  on your notes, those on your mind? Let's check that out. I'll probably ask Jonas in about it. So alternatively, if we realize that we can't do the whole thing in one go, we could probably just process some sort of metadata, you know what I mean? Like sort of for the whole series, chunks representing the individual meetings or something. Like something that represents the whole series  in a structure very similar to the structure which we represent individual meetings. But with data sort of always combined from the whole series. So instead of having a single utterance that we display, we'd probably be like that would be representing a whole topic, a segment in a meeting. And so that using the same data. You mean that you basically split up the big thing into  different summaries. For example, that you have a very top level summary and a separate five for each number. I'm thinking of in a sense of creating a virtual meeting out of the whole meeting series. That's easy, just like create a new XML document. Yeah, sort of like offline create a virtual meeting which basically treats the meeting series as if it was a meeting and treats the  individual meetings within this series as if they were segments and treats the individual segments within meetings as if they were utterances. You know, so it just sort of shifted one level up. And that way we could probably use the same algorithm and just like make like one or two ifs that say, okay, if you are on whole document, a whole series level and that was a double click then don't just go into that segment but load a new file or something like it. But in general use the same algorithm that would  You know, if you can't actually load the whole thing and... Because also, like, even if we... Maybe this whole, like, maybe I'm worrying too much about the whole series in one thing display, because actually, I mean, probably users wouldn't view that one too often. I don't think it's really that much of a problem, because if it's too big, what we can do is just, well, all the offline stuff doesn't really matter. And all we can do is just process a bit of time, like, for summarization. Say we wanted 100 ushances in the summer.  just look at the meeting, take the top 100 entrances and each other meeting if it scores high and the ones already in the summary so far just replace them and then you only have to process one meeting at a time. Yeah, but I'm still worried like for some further display if you actually if you wanted to play like for the whole series their information density levels based on and the and the only granularity you have this individual art for instance that means you have to go through every  We think Lattrance in a series of 70 hours of meeting. We should build a store and main measure for the segment meetings as well. And if you make that structurally very similar to one level down, like the way how we store individual Lattrance and stuff, then maybe we can more or less use the same code and just make a few ifs and stuff. So in general, we're having up-transers.  And they have a score. And that's as much as we really need. And they also have a time information, of course. And speaker information. Yeah. Top hex segmenting. Oh, need as well. Yes, so an information which topic they are in. Yeah. And probably separate to that an information about the different topics like that. Yeah.  So the skimming can work on that because the skimming just sort of sorts the utterances and puts as many in as it needs to preserve the order when it's displayed. Yeah, it'll play them in some order in which they were said because otherwise it's going to be more entertaining. But that's enough data for the skimming and the searching, what the searching does is the searching leaves the whole  framework goes to the SQL database and gets like basically then gets just a time mark for whether it's like that out of your concern with and then we have to find I'm sure there's some way in in that XML to just say set position to that time mark and then it shifts the whole frame in the delights everything element of the display and the display updates. You know what? Into the old G display as well for multiple results. Yeah. Yeah. That we can. Yeah, but so if if some so yeah  So if in that tree display somebody clicks on something. You just need to find the playing stamp. Yeah, and then you sort of feed the timestamp to a monitex mail central manager and that central manager alerts everything that they are like alerts the skim like the audio display alerts the text display alerts the visual display and says we have a new timeframe and then they all sort of do the update routines with respect to the current level of zoom. So how much did it display and starting position at where there or maybe the mid position of it? I don't know like  If you start when the thing was found or if the thing was found is in the middle of the part that we display that I don't know what that we can decide about. But in general, it's the same thing, whether you play and it moves forward or whether you jump to a position through search, it's essentially for all the window handling, it's the same event. It's only that the event gets triggered by the search routine, which sort of pushed it into an eye attack's meta and says, please go there now. So we should basically make our  the  have to change the utterance document, right? Because the whole way, like the whole beauty of the night, it's melodic, it ties together lots of different files so we can just create an additional XML file which for every utterance, like the utterance of ID is a presume, some references. So we tie just a very short XML file which it's the only information it has, it has whatever a number for the, wait for the information density, we just tie that to the existing utterance, and tie them to the existing speaker changes.  But there's no idea for an utterance. I think it's just for individual words. So how do we do that then? And I know it's for utterance as well. I think it's just for one word. So we have two.  some integer that we just increment from top to bottom sort of to every utterance as an ID, or try to understand how an ID is working, maybe there's some special rules we have to follow when we use these IDs. I'm not quite sure. I've only seen that the individual words have got an ID.  So I guess that would be solved, I believe not. Yeah, you always could have a look at the timestamps and then take the ones that belong together to form an atrent. I think we would just take the segments that are already there. Yeah, there's a segment. You know the x-mail segments. Okay. Is that a board marker pen actually?  Let's just like to make a list of all this stuff over here. We can somebody can do it in paper. All these fancy pens. So what, so this stuff we have, we have utterances and speakers and waits for utterances. So for every utterance, sort of like the utterance has a speaker and a wait which is coming from outside, which is tied to it.  There is segments, which are the segments. Also, sorry. Yeah, that's a topic. Topic segments are meant like they're a super unit. So the utterances are tied to topic segments. And if the timestamps are on a word level, then we somehow have to extract timestamps for our instances where they start.  for the segments.  And basically it's words that are added in a sequence without pauses, but sometimes however there are short pauses in it and they're indicated by square brackets, so that's one segment or two segments then. The annotators decided what was one segment and what wasn't.  which is called, sorry, segments is that which features called utterances now. I get to say, one person's contribution at a time sort of thing eating it. Okay, so yeah, so we have those and then we have some field somewhere else which has top picks. Yeah, and the topics basically they're just an ID probably with a start time or something and the utterances reference to those topics I guess. Yeah, so the topics  I think for some annotations an actual  because it's sort of like it's just a time window. So if this lazy loading works and they should definitely fit into, I mean, not memory then because it wouldn't all be memory at the same time. So if you just have to have that information like long list of all the utterances, slash segments and like shorter smaller lists which give weight to them. And even though probably if there's a lot of overhead and having two different files, we can probably merge  the weights into it offline. If there's a lot of bureaucracy involved with having two different trees and whether one ties to the other because the one has to wait for the other then it's probably quicker to just know why don't we just write it. So L file, can I handle just loading arbitrary new like attributes and stuff? I mean I would have thought they'd make it able to. Yeah I thought that was the whole beauty that you can just make a new XML file and sort of tie that to the other and it's just why do we need  have two XML trees in memory. Oh, yeah. So no, I didn't mean tree. No, no, I meant just like handling two different files internally sort of. I was just thinking, you know, like if, if the overhead for having the same amount of data coming from two files instead of from one file is massive, then it would probably be for us easy to just like offline, put the, the weight into, into the file that has the segments. Yeah, segments slash our trends is already, but that we can figure out. I mean, if it's going around the  The other thing is that would mean we'd be easing their parser as well which means we wouldn't have to pass anything which would be quite nice. Is that a parser for much faster than anything we'd come up with anyway? Yeah. Yeah, no, we'd be completely using like the whole infrastructure. Basically just I mean the main difference really between our project and the S really is that we load a different part of the data but otherwise we're doing it the same way that they are doing it. So we're just sort of running different types of queries on it. I think we are running  query is not just about what we load and what we don't load, but we are running queries in the sense that we dynamically select by weights, don't we? That we have to check how fast that it's like to say, give us all the ones that, whether that works with the query language, whether that's too many results and whether we should. You know, if it, let's say, I mean, if they're query language is strange and if it would return 10 million results in it, can't handle it, then we can just,  the  Keep the same infrastructure, but every individual module like the player and the displays they like they still get sort of all the different references All the different pieces, but they say oh this piece I leave out because it's below the current threshold level. I think we probably want to store a Hierarchal information density as well like an implement mation density score for each meeting and each topic segment because otherwise we'll be recalcoding the same  over and over again. Yeah, that'd be much more efficient to do. And that will obviously make it much easier to display. When do we need the one for the meet? Or may not for the whole meeting, but like. Yeah, I guess for the so when we have to display where we display the whole series, then if we have for the individual topic segments within the meetings, if we have ready calculator measures, then we don't have to sort of extract that data from the individual utterances. Yeah, and that's also fairly easy to store along with our segments as well.  for the segments are we extracting some type of title for them that we craft with some fancy algorithm manually are we just taking the single most highly valued keyword utterance for the segment heading well we can start off like that well I was gonna start off off of got some halfway through infronting one that does just idea and then just change that to work on whatever it's probably like it  And then probably it wouldn't be the best thing if it's just the most highly ranked phrase or keyword because like for example for an introduction that would most definitely not be anything that has any title anywhere similar to introduction. There should be wasted by stuff like the hotspots and the keywords and the search for that. Also like for this part maybe if we go over with named entity in the end if I mean if one of the people doing deal has some named entity code to spare and just let's  at least for the sort of finding topics titles for segments just take a name then to T. which has a really high what's it called? DFI DFI DFI. Because you'd probably be quite likely if they're talking about a conference or a person that that would be a name then to T. which is very highly frequented in that part. I thought he said there wasn't very many. Yeah, he said there quite sparse so that basically was stone border basing too much of each general calculation on it but like especially if there are sparse probably individual  name the entities which describe what a segment is about would probably be quite good. Like if there's some name of some conference, they could probably say that name of the conference quite often. Even though he's right that they make indirect references to it.  for a bass line really. You're able to do that in trouble, you? Well, I'm halfway through. It's not working out there. It will do. So you're doing that on a per word level? Yeah. And then averaging it over the utterances. But it's not related to the corpus at all. It's just working on an arbitrary text while it's moving. OK, co. I was just wondering, were you at the corpus from at the moment?  So it seems that the data structure isn't a big problem and that basically we don't have to have all these massive discussions of how we exactly interact with the data structure because most of our work isn't done with the data structure in memory in the browser, but it's just done offline and everyone can represent it anyway. They want as long as they sort of store it in a useful, like the matter of representation in the end. So it would be useful to know how everyone's going to store their things.  Yeah, that would mean understanding the night XML, like smells sort of formatted a lot more detail. We should, I think we should just have a long session in the computer room together and like now that we know a bit more what we want to take a closer look. Yeah, that night it got me a few hours free. Yeah, I thought of this. I thought of the look at the topic segments, how it's stored. And then there's a few per meeting and it gives a timestamp  and inside each one there's the actual it utterance segments and the less of them like hard and they're all numbered and so that's a lot stored. Yeah, haven't looked at this stuff much at all. So I guess if I'm going to be segmenting it with the LCC then that's the scene format I'd want to put it back out and should be equivalent.  Who's sort of doing the central coordination of the browser application or integration? Would you mean integration? Yeah, but also all these elements, like the loading and integration and handling the data loading and stuff. I think I'll take over there to splatius because I started with a bit  and found it, found it doable. So somebody should sort of be the one person who understands most about what's centrally going on with the project, like with the browser as a whole and with the data comes in and...  It's also complicated. I guess we can do it like several people together. It's probably just those people have to work together a lot very closely and just make sure that they always understand what the other one is doing. I guess the important thing is to get the crucial modules built or a great standard simple version of them or already made versions of them for that  and then we'll maybe have to prioritize somebody into integrating it.  to really see how much the work that they're doing is making sense because you just... where I guess you can see something from the data that you have in your individual XML files that you create but it will be nice to have some basic system. It's just to display some stuff. So maybe we should try doing something really simple like just displaying a whole meeting and like just being able to scroll through it or something like that. Or just adapt like that. Just sort of go from the  see how we could, how we could arrange, like, adapt the tower system. Does anyone want to like, just sit with me and like play for three hours with Natex Mel at some point? I agree after this. I wouldn't like to be, I'd like to go to the gym, I'm theoretically free, but if there's any time. I'm afraid I am. Some are full Friday.  You have nothing no for a time on Wednesday Wednesday I've got a nine till twelve Nantle twelve than nothing you have for you in the afternoon I've got nothing in the afternoon anytime Wednesday afternoon I'd be okay, so yeah We're about just enough to tell you for us to whatever once easy to discuss stuff. I don't know. I'll be in  Okay, what time do you want to do? Well, I'll be there from 12. I've got some other stuff and needs done on Matt Labs, so if you're not there at 12, I can just work on that. Okay, so I'll just meet you in 18 in the afternoon.  I don't know what it means, but I don't know what it means.  I was more thinking of the whole browser framework as a running program now. I think we all need the raw text in different flavors, don't we?  Yeah, I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that I would say that  Okay. What I found out was that there are quite a lot of things without timestamps in the beginning. Yes, but that's just an idea of something. Yeah, everything that's the word has a time stamp. Yes, but what are the other things that's some kind of number, maybe the final number or something that is in the beginning? What is that?  I think there are quite a lot of numbers in the beginning where there's no timestamp for the numbers. I think they say quite a lot of numbers before that there's this number. Number within the XML context. Yeah there are numbers in the W tag but there are no timestamps. Are they spoken number? Do they look like they're utterances? Yeah. There's the number task isn't there.  I think it wouldn't. It would be because in every meeting. It would probably make the, yeah, if you have segments for that, probably be.  I think it even has its own annotation like digits or something. So it would be really easy too. I just think like it probably like the LSA would perform quite well on it. We'll probably find another number test quite easily. A constraint for cap area with a high co-occurrence of the same nine words. But what is it actually that numbers? It's just to test the system I think. So what they are no timestamps. I think it's also something that they said the numbers in order, right?  They have to read numbers. Yeah, I think it sounded like they wanted to check out how well they were doing with overlapping and stuff because basically it's like they're reading them at different speeds but you know in which order they are said. I didn't have a look at that so. XC has some reasons for doing it. That's the thing like the numbers at the end of the review. And also there are different combinations of letters  I thought it was a little too upto to take care of my meeting.  That's not that specific occurrence of the word token but of a given word form because you make accounts for words just being a dictionary. Yes, we should work together because I need a dictionary as well. I was just gonna use the hash map one in Java because I'm only gonna do it on small documents. It's just like until the information density is up and running. Just signed a good give me time to work with. Didn't you say that? There was a lot of these quite small documents, you see? To start with?  I'm just wondering for the whole thing. Who was it of you to set that there's some program which spits out a dictionary probably with frequency? It's rainbow. I think it's just an exunary in the first place, but Is anyone of you for the document frequency over total frequency? You gonna have total frequency to words then with that right like over the whole  Why does it need to be classified into different segments?  We're looking for is the frequency statistics. I don't see how that would be changed by the classification. If we need just frequencies maybe we should just calculate them by using Perl or something. Or there may be another tool available. It's quite easy to just count and solve them by or frequency. Using which tool are you talking about?  script be careful with that like my experience with the British National Coppus was that there's far more word types than you ever think because anything that's sort of unusual generally is a newer type like any typo or any strange thing where they put two words together and also any number is a word type of its own so you can easily end up with hundred thousands of words when you didn't expect them So generally dictionaries can grow bigger than you think they do I don't know how many terms you can handle  You can probably obviously you can probably pre-filter like with regular expressions even just say if it consists of only digits then skip it or even if it consists any special character if it's then skip because it's probably something with a doctor between which is usually not something you want to have and I Can't remember who's got it might be wordnet But one of these big corpses has a list of stop words that you can download and they're just basically lists of really uninteresting boring words that we could  filter out before we do that. It's like that's one of the papers I read. That's one of the things I did right at the beginning is they've got this big stop list and they just ignore all of those. But I did for my project I just ignored the 100 most frequent words because they actually end up all being articles and everything and stuff. So we need like several of us need a dictionary  Am I the only one who needs it with frequency?  of the dice machines. It's a hate working on dice. It's awful. Like, so he needs my home machine. Oh, yeah, burning it on a, like we should be able to burn the whole course. Just pick. Where has a CD? Ah, yeah, I support about that two days ago in the informatics building there. Sorry, in Appleton Tower 5, they want to close two machines closest to the support office. So I presume I would have to be excited. I think he's talking about sort of the  the right hand corner. Yeah, if you enter the big room in the right hand corner I think. The thing is, you can only burn from the local file system. So if it's from, well actually I think if it's mounted you can directly burn from there but the problems I have my data on beefy and so I have to get it into the local temp directory and burn it from there but you can burn from there. How big is it without... Are we looking at that now? We looked at that now. We looked at that now for God.  I would offer you to get it on this one and then they copied but you know what I figured out I'm quicker downloading of a broadband.  How they mounted which is unfortunate I'll see if I can see here I suppose What operating system do you have? I've got a Linux, what kind of Windows box? What connection do you have at home? Yeah, so if anyone of us gets it we can then just use next CD. I can get burn it to CD or put it on hard to spread ever.  the temperature  can SSH into directly off SSH. Yeah, well, I can do it from that session. Gone. I can compress it from a remote session and I see here from the same session. Yeah, they probably hate you for doing it. They probably they'd like you more if you SSH into another computer, compress it there and then sort of copy it into the gateway machine.  Do you think?  else, it's just details on how to get stuff home from. We can probably just look at that together when we're meeting. Okay, just wanted, so who's then doing the frequencies on the words? Because I think I could also make use of it for the agreement and disagreement thing.  I talked about using the discourse acts first and then in the chunks of text I found looking for word patterns and so on. So I would for example need the most frequent words. So if you cut off all that, it would be as soon as  Somebody gives me the raw text of the whole thing. I can probably just implement like a five-line Java hash table frequency dictionary builder and see. Yeah, but I needed for my chunks then I would, you know, did you not say frequency for words and the whole sort of thing? Yeah, but I would like to look at the frequency of words in my, in the regions of text I found out to be interesting. So I wouldn't need  It would have to be recalculated. But first, how big are the chunks? How big are the chunks? I think it would be as big as the hotspot annotations. So quite small there. So you could use just the same thing we used to build the big dictionary.  I  algorithm which does a hash table dictionary with frequency from a raw text and the raw text can be anything. So how far are you getting raw text out of it? Do you think? I can get all the raw text but it has to be audit still. Okay, well that's good because for the dictionary the audit doesn't make it a little bit. So yeah, so I'll get that from you and I'll write the hash table which goes over that and creates a dictionary file. So for the dictionary  Is it okay if I do whatever word blank frequency or something? Just could everybody sort of start from that? I mean I guess we can... Well that's it. I use in TF idea for the information density. It's in what is implemented in Rayverse information gain and I'm not quite sure how they calculate that. Frequency would be useful I think. Yeah. I need frequency as well.  Depending on the context, the size and what we consider a document in the sense of calculating Tf is going to change. Which might need to thinking about. I think we might have a lot in common what we calculated because I, for my Latin semantic analysis, need like counts of words within a document, within a segment actually, within a topic segment. That's what's rainbow, so I think you can just get probabilities for certain words for each  Document can I convert these probabilities back into frequencies? I would have to look at that. Okay. So that's what rainboders because that's what LSA builds on. I get builds a document by frequency matrix. So I could probably get that even though but I already have I already have my code to build it up myself. Not on board. I have my code already. Yes, so Dave, you said you need the frequency counts actually for the  So yeah, for a document, but you say not for the whole world. You need to rule frequency as well. But you also need how many times things occur within each document. And what we consider a document is going to depend on our context, I think. Because if we're looking at the whole lot of meetings, we'll consider each meeting a document in terms of this algorithm.  viewing like say just a small topic segment you might look at even each utterance as a small document. It more and more appears to me that if we if we scrap the notion of the meeting as an individual thing in sort of jit see meetings as as topic segments and have sort of like hierarchical topic segmentation instead then it's like a more thing here in framework.  So, it's going to need some thought of how actually maybe it doesn't actually matter. Maybe if you just do it once at the highest level it will be fine. But I just think it might be difficult to calculate the TFI, the FIF line for all the different levels we might want. Because if we're going to allow disjoint segments, for example, then how are we going to know what's going to be in context at any given time?  If you just did it globally treating a meeting as a document it probably still be Workout fine because you don't need to be comparing with everyone's within the car. Are we using this for the waiting in the end now this this measure you're calculating? I don't know. I thought we can use that in the end See information density  Because if we're doing I think for for the information density we We should calculate it on the lowest level on the highest but sorry. I mean like Yeah, very each word or whatever but across the whole lot is what I mean by highest level across the whole course Yeah, but it don't you have to like go sort of like for In a document versus the whole thing isn't that how it works that you look Yeah, really pretty look at each meeting is a document  I think that's a good idea because isn't it like that we expect the to change over with different topic segments more that they're talking about something different in each different topic segment? Possibly. Because that's what relative term frequency is about that like in some context they're talking more about a certain word than in general. So they would more be the  topic segments then. And that's what I thought as well that probably the topic segment level is the most informative words. Are they big enough to get anything in me as well? And that's the problem I don't know. I'm just wondering if there's ways to abandon the whole concept of of meetings and sort of  But just not really treating separate meetings as too much of a separate entity. Yeah, that is not it's not an issue you just concatenate in XML file together, but we still want to have like a notion of meetings for the user Yes But on algorithmic level whether we actually whether there's some way to just represent meetings is a topics Yeah, you just like whatever you want to look at you just jam together into an XML file and that's your meeting even though  it may have come from all over the place or whatever. I don't see why that's really a big problem. That's not really what I meant, but I think I have to think more about what I meant. I'm confused about everything. So basically what you're saying is you can take an arbitrary amount of data and process it with the same algorithm. It doesn't matter conceptually what that data is. It could be a meeting, it could be two utterances, it could be a  meeting plus half-ming from somewhere else.  In general, at some level, super topics are treated like topics. I don't think it's very difficult though. I mean, what you do is you just build next, ML file. And if you want it to get down to the entrances, you'd go to the leaves. And then if you want it to the next level up, you'd go to the parents of those and just go from the leaves inwards towards the branch to build up things like when you click on a segment, it's going to have like  Word to whatever important. As long as like the algorithm to design with it in mind, I think it's very good for them. So, is it just rapid again, do? Well, like, say you had, like, say for a meeting, like you've got, like, say a hierarchy that looks quite big like this.  And like the utterances come off of here maybe. Then whenever your algorithm is doing, as long as when you're working with utterances you go for all the leaves, then if you need something next up, so like a topic segment you'd go to here, but if you're looking at say this one, so only went like this. Right, so you say you'd start with the leaves and you go, oh I want a topic segment, so I go one more time.  layer up. See? And then if you're working with just the topic segment there, you see anything you have to worry about. And like each time you want a higher level, you just need to go up the tree. As long as you're algorithm respects that, then we can just process any arbitrary XML file with whatever hierarchy structure we want. So that would be the series as a whole. That would be sort of a meeting.  I'm a bit brain damaged at the moment, but I think I'll just sit together with you again and go through it again. So I think as long as you build an algorithm that respects whatever structures in the file, rather than imposing its own structure. So is this in this structurally then always identical? Well, no, it doesn't happen.  with the same algorithm or I mean it could be as many nodes as you want. This one could be deeper maybe. So then you start with all your utterances here and when you go up to get top experiments you go to here, here, here, here, here. That might be a bit confusing though because you have things on different levels. Yeah, not sure how we can go from bottom up, I've always thought it's like more than, oh I have a map.  I can't think of it at the moment. Probably this is all too complicated worrying about that at that moment. Is there anything else we should discuss? Now I have to be happy to start at anything, are we doing anything? Well, Wednesday. Wednesday we are meeting and looking at the  at their implementation in some more detail to understand what's going on. So we'll see if we can get like a mini browser just displays two things sync together. Yeah, two things from their stuff just to make sure that we are like, understand that we understand that enough to modify it. It's been a half like a directory or something where we can put all our code in there. That kind of thing. Maybe useful. I don't know if you see about that. Yeah. How would we do that?  by just making like it read right for everyone Okay, who is most free space on there? I know, I love it. Same here. I thought you got a reasonable amount because everything on my mind is about and actually be deleted because I store it all the way in as well. Well, alternatively, we can probably just make another directory on the beefy scratch space. I mean, that's where I'm having  I think he sent support he'd probably be less in a better position. Yeah.  I think he said yes to that. I think that was like when we were still in the seminar room I asked that once or like ask is it possible to get it off and nobody said like people are discussing about the technicality but nobody said anything about all being allowed or not allowed. I mean we have access to it here and  I guess it probably means that we can't give it to anybody else, but if they give us access to it here, sitting on our diet machine, then there shouldn't be a reason why we shouldn't be able to use it on our laptop. I personally don't have too many friends who would be too keen on getting it anyway. I have this really excited pirate copied. I don't hate it meeting data.  you're extracting, looking like then at the end. It will be best. At the moment it's just I think it's actually very similar to what I did for my speaker extraction. And I think I would perhaps have to change two lines of code to get you for each meeting a fire that says from this millisecond to this millisecond.  and there was this sequence of words and so on. So let's just change in two lines of code and it would give you that. So do you extract the words, the raw text as well? Yeah, so far I extracted the duration but it's from the words file so I couldn't just print it.  the words instead of the durations and it should be very straightforward. I can try to do it and say to you, I can't, I have a look at it. It makes sense for what you want.  So we already extracted from all the files. I mean, I just let it run over all the files. So you also order? Yes. Wait, where it's embedded? Yeah, sorry. I was according to the starting time. So, the utterances. What I just realized we should really keep different series is completely separate for virtually all purposes.  Be careful about that because the XC corpus isn't one meeting series, several meeting series with different people meeting for completely different things. Yeah, I mean, I have one, what I give you would be one fire for each meeting. For each meeting. Yeah, not for each meeting series. Okay, but let's just be careful that whatever we sort of emerge together, like the highest level of merging, it's not the whole XC corpus, but  individual serious might be funny to see what is summarized the whole course I think we might be very young as probably be somewhere like well or something like that I think we might just get away with for the whole project just like looking at only one serious and just doing within one serious I mean you can do everything you want in one series I mean that's one series that has just one meeting oh yeah let's take  Is the data always clearly split up at a different series? It's easy to just pick one. The data is of the form. You have three identification letters. So, B, E, D or B, B, D or something. And that's always the same group. And then after that, there's a number like a one or a two. So, at every level, everyone has to be careful to really just take, even at the highest level, just take stuff from one series, not merge stuff from different series.  that would probably be just majorly messy. So if you make one single text file which has the whole corpus of our corpus, there will still be from one series only. But would you producing at the moment is individual text files that have the raw text for a meeting as a whole? Yes. But as the start times,  for each meeting at zero, you could just probably just add the finer second time to the next meeting and so on and just put it all together. But then we would have to change the information about who on which channel it was set by which person it was set and that is actually started in another XML document.  I'm creating a real raw text thing at the moment which is just the words. That's why I'm gonna need it. Yeah, that's why I need it. But if they are... It's not an end time just for the file, it's just the first and the last line or is it for every single thing in? No, it's for every single word. Or for every single utterance. So what do you mean by just not print out that?  I would just, if you're into it, can you make a text file which just like makes just the words? Okay. Do you want it straight flowing? Because I would need something that marks the end of, of, uh, is your segmented by topics standard? Like, is there any information that you have to do topic to the automatic topic? No, I didn't. Or then I need something different later anyway. I'll give it for now if you. That's what a mail see say does it.  You're going to put that as an output of your segmentation. For now, can you create a dumb, which pure text, just pure text that I can get a dictionary, and you can work on that for your topic segmentation? And you would want that all in one file for all the corpus for the series. But I can also deal with separate files. I mean, I can just write the algorithm that it loads all files in a directory or something.  Yeah, I can directly put it. Well, if you can put it in one single mega file, that would be quite useful for me. So only words, meeting series. Even though for you, wouldn't it be easy if you had different files? Because then you sort of know, like, for me, it's better if they're buying. So give me different files as long as like, if you could name them in a way that is easy to enumerate over them, like whatever, one, two, three, four, five or something. It's just anything that I can  Yeah, they will just I will just take over take over the names. They have anyway. Yeah, is it something that's easily like too numerator? Or is it some some ordered pattern? Yeah, one series has the same three starting letters. Okay, cool. Yeah, so only words and words and times. I don't need the times that just need the words but um, and the right or yeah, you want to do all that. Okay.  Okay, anyway, wait, wait, orders. I'm art based at times. Yeah, and do you want, yeah, sometimes they're contained in one another. So yeah, it doesn't matter too much. Just after. Okay. Order. Only words. When do you think you'll have a matter?  Like a primitive segmentation but I'm ready made topic segmentation but I'm ready made tool ready. Okay cool. I'll leave that then when it's done. Yeah hopefully that's weak. And I think for all the corpus it's just for what I know for my time since I'm 9 megabyte to have means should be similar.  What's not megabatt? All the words together and for other meetings? That sounds quite reasonable. That's nine characters. I'm guessing that you know what I because nine megabatt is what I got for when I say for every utterance this goes from there to there. Okay. Are we taking one particular series at the moment or?  I'm doing it for Alvin. Doesn't matter. OK. Yeah, I guess we can fully process the data for all different series and then check which series is the best for the presentation. It's also quite reasonable to make a better meaning if you think if it's roughly a million words and nine characters for words. I hope it will be the same for the words. It's just what I... Yeah.  So I'll create a dictionary.  And just one file of the first meeting to all those who needed so that you can have a look whether you want. And then the actual file we can probably like copy from your home directory or something like it. Yeah, I mean if it's just for one meeting it's really not to be. Yeah, but I'm saying for the whole thing in the end to like the big thing we probably shouldn't do by you know. Yeah.  So from the time I get the file I can do that in the next sort of the next morning. Yeah. Well, you mean how long processing time it takes? I have to block standard algorithm. I've written it for a deal just in half an hour, something similar. It's just you put them in a hash table and say, well, if it exists already in the hash table, then you increase the count by one end. I probably implement some filter for filtering out numbers or something.  Because it's quite easy in Perl as well. That's just a line of code for counting all the words. Really? How do you do that? Yes. By hashes? Okay, well I don't know any problem. If anyone wants to do a Perl script for that, that does it. Yes. It's a nicely. I have no problem with that. But I think I have the Java code virtually ready because for Dileverodes something very similar like for Dileverodes something that counts there. The different occurrences of all the  X.  which is the serialization of an agency passing the file representation of it and now it's either using it in Java anyway. So I'd just be building the data structure again. I'll check if I understand how it works. Otherwise I can give you the code for loading a dictionary. It's just, it's sort of a line break separated file. It seems like a bit silly to be passing it over and over again kind of thing. Yeah.  Yeah, I see if I understand how to serialize this. There's a serialized command so that gives me one mega mother of thought that I think all the collections and things implement serializable already. Yeah, but do they automatically write to the file? Anyway, I figured that out. Yes, that's pretty much it. So Dave and me look at  how night x-mail works and we're out trying to use the works more on the TFID as I'm going to do the audio thing. I'll build a dictionary as soon as I get the text. So that... When do we have to meet again then with this?  was we just getting on with our components. So how are we going to demonstrate the next week? Yes, demonstrate something. What do we have to demonstrate? No, not demonstrate, but like didn't you say that we sort of agree that it would be useful to demonstrate or if it like some primitive thing working like I suggested that you could have an initial prototype. That's got to be very proud to type. I'll be surprised if we can get anything.  I feel like hanging mid-air and not really like finding a point where you can get your teeth in it and start working properly. Yeah, it's also fuzzy though.  to justify ourselves that it's not as like focus specification of most well. Yeah, but at the moment, but at the moment it's also an implementation I level like with the data structures. I'm just like over these vague ideas of some trees. Once we start doing it, it will become more and less obvious. I think. Yeah. It's just we are halfway through the project time. Let's just freaks me out.  We should have kept one fish on. You're a person who emails anyway. So you have a writing email that's not even me. Yeah.  I have no  I have some points, AI, they're here, machine learning, which is quite a bit in itself. But everything, and I've done every form of computation, like with things, and everything algorithms here, and that first, just here, and that. Yeah, but like nothing that has rules, like I don't like rules in any aspect of life, like I don't like them, and then code it, or so. Which is really bad, not like I had, any of them there are a lot of people that have done it, so they have never...  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  you  Yeah, you just got a little bit lost.  It's with cameras. It looks quite funny. This is supposed to look like. I saw that. Nice.  Yes  Okay Yes, so I'm just to just realize I don't have power let me switch on the other way. We're gonna run out Okay  So, there's probably not much to talk about at the moment in terms of like talking about each other's stuff. I mean beyond what we've been talking about yesterday. So what I've been thinking is maybe if we try to really make sense together of the XML format to be sure that we can all produce the data that we are producing in a way, or at least, I mean, I guess,  This might at all probably load in completely different way anyway because it's matrix but all the stuff that goes as annotation that we have in the right format. Maybe if we just sort of pull what we know about the XML format and try to make sense of it. I don't, it all know how to go about this. What I did just now is I download it.  I downloaded some files, some XML files. And I was thinking, if we maybe just should go through some of them and try to see if you understand the general structure and put together what we think about the structure, what we think the things mean. And then talk about how the annotation for information density stuff should maybe be structured in a similar way.  I don't really have an idea like what otherwise what we would do today in this meeting. I mean. Yeah, we haven't got much to talk about. Just maybe talk about how you would give me your data file. Yeah. What's that part? That's the interface between having the topic segments and calculating the information importance of words.  I would need separate files for each segment or just maybe have delimiters in between. Yeah, well, that's the way it works. It's called dilemma or example. Okay. Yeah, you have to do that. Yeah. And you send you need a label for each segment. I mean, the most you don't need. I can give you an ID, but be quick. The text will give a topic. I just title just need a title from the file, but doesn't matter what it is. Okay. Yeah, that's not problem.  Yes, so does anyone have a good idea where to start? So what is it we're talking about getting in at the moment? We're basically just because the two of you will merge your data together, right? In some way, in the end, it'll result in one annotation. So the only thing we're trying to tie in is just an additional annotation, which is similar to the annotation about what would be most similar to simply to the segmentation information.  Yes, but I mean they're all very similar over sex my effect. I had a look at the, for example, AS. Oh, see that's what I was thinking. Not sure what software I have at the moment. Hello?  Does anyone know any good standards or for that display's XML? Sure. Take Mozilla? Yeah, but I'm afraid I only have five folks and five folks doesn't have the nice XML view anymore. I think I don't have Mozilla. I can probably just remix them.  And when we are mixing our values together, is it a value for each expression for each sentence or something? Yeah, I think that would be, I mean, for me it's quite difficult to say on, you know, what's cope one, annotation would have, I think it would be certainly more than one word.  would work best with a transfer so segments. I would just end up with values for each word so I wouldn't have any boundaries for segments at all. I just would have the words and then how long each expression would be, I don't know. But going from a work business wouldn't it be to then go back and calculate for each other and  What is an utterance? What we should turn safely. I think just the segments as they are segmented. What we would fit into the XML files would be a value for each utterance. I think so. You would probably still need a mirror, I just follow the words.  for the keywords that are displayed when you click on something. I would have to fit in more than just one value. But that's another representation then, I think, for the importance. Does anyone know in which file the actual, what's it called, the splitting into the utterances? And the not segments. Is it called, it's not that well got. No, it's not that.  For example, BDB-001C point. What does it end with sex? Does that look like it? I can't see anything like that. I think that's it. Yeah, I think that's it. Yeah. We have all got an ID for each author. Let's actually just see if maybe K right. How much time is spent just getting the rest of the going?  Is that better to see? I guess you have white and black is better to see? Yeah, it's better. I have a little flutter. I have a little flutter. I see if I can... ...are you... Okay.  So, okay, so here that is for each segment. That's really all segments. I mean, it can be words or topics or anything I think in these. That's why it's, for example, time provenance, dialogue, time provenance, segment or time provenance. Yeah, let's go a different file speaker.  there's a mean this doesn't contain any content like any text. No, it's points to the words. Oh wait somebody says somebody explained that slowly it's me. So it was some of them point to the words other hours point to the dialogue actually. So that's kind of the noble thing that ties together. So what do all these things in this file have in common? What are they?  Yeah, they have their night ID the time number like so they are they are segments in what sense well, what's the definition of utterances but also includes things like the segment is what is displayed in one line and And that's usually dialogue what what's the difference between the problem dialogue acting between segment and it looks The segment thing looks in the into the words  And the data gets. I think it's a dialogue. And a different dialogue. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets.

And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets. And a data gets  So the stuff that's called segment here that we know which file this is pulling from. For yet, it's from Word6. We're saying here. Let's receive a word6. So let's for example, let's just get below. So we would need a value label for each of those segments that are not dialogues.  for all those that point to the actual words. Okay, let me just try to get the more to difference screen. Just trying to arrange them instead of if you have one above the other so to make some sense of that.  So now here we had I think the segments first perhaps not exactly what we are looking at because let's just want one tying all the others together and the information or I mean we are going to create a file that looks more like the words I think well I'm just trying to understand what this is  The second one is about referencing two in the words file.  basically be a sequence, right? Yes. So that's from W52. Are they not ordered? W52 down to W. What do we talk about? Yeah. Sorry. To this course marker, this F marker, 0.5? Yeah, that's there. No, no, I'm up.  Okay, so this is somebody saying it it doesn't Do we actually see from this file who's doing it sort of interest? So this is where he like time stops and Then it only starts at a later time because or you don't see when I'm pointing us for this So then it starts here this time against speak a deep  between there somebody else. Yes, you can see whether there's somebody else or not. You can see that in the W point first it's W point 554 and then it's 76. So there there's number of addresses of others because of between. Okay, so the the file with annotations for information density. What would that be like? Would that be like the segments file giving a start word and end word or  or would that be to best tie in with the system? Yeah, I think we would also need two of those. I think we would have to have the same structure one that points to it where we tie together all our information. So we would perhaps have to... Something like this, or where you give sort of a reference to a beginning in an end position? Yes. And then another one that  Would perhaps give the actual probability value? Well, that would be in the same file, wouldn't it? It would just... Yeah, it could. Couldn't we have a like... I guess we could introduce a different... But if you have several layers, then... Can't represent the model the same file? Well, for now, if we just do something which for every segment in here attaches, actually, can we not tie it to the segments file?  the way they would want it to do it. If we in the end we want to attach to each of those segments one number for now. Those segments have to have an ID. Yeah, I guess they do. So this is the ID for specific segment, right? Yeah, so wouldn't it? I mean, the problem is they've made me have looked at the exact in the workings of the engineer, but you'd think that the easiest way and the way that how it's intended  to be would be just if we have here a link to the segment, like an ID for that segment that we just create another file which links to the segment and then has an additional value which is the number. So you mean an attribute? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm an actually. Yeah, sorry, I thought you were talking about having two files. I was thinking, yeah, I think I thought you were wanting to have two different XML  We won the reference and one just the number and I was thinking that's probably what you meant just having like for each sort of our segments having just the ID which is referencing to these segments here and another attribute which is the value So this whole information would then store in this on that I don't have access to because I didn't download like this there's one meta information file where it describes the structure of all the files and describes which  which attributes they bring in. So we would add that to that file, saying that we bring in information density, and then we would create a file of that type which we probably couldn't call it segment. We probably might have to have different word for it, I'm not sure if it does any trouble with it repeating.  I don't know that's probably not very nice, but it would be quite easy wouldn't it? Yeah, right, actually, if we make a copy of it. But I mean, that's not all the information that is in the corpus in there in the segments fire. I think that is just the things that are loaded every time, but we have lazy loading. So it can load more than that. First, we could just try to  I mean, I don't know if I want to have a lazy load, but I have no idea how that works. What are you saying about the lazy loading apply to everything? I mean, that it's sort of dynamically good. Yes, but it has a basic thing that it loads, I think. So for example, every time it loads the segment things, it can't not display words, I think.  of the segments for every time. I think so. That's how I understood it. The segment at the moment is split up because otherwise in the other things there's no information about what the participant name is and so on. So in the segments, it's really very basic that have to be displayed for anything. But they display the segments in the utterances in the  So they have, they have, they utterances displayed in their interface. So that they access probably this file and then they display the words, so why shouldn't we be able to do that?  So maybe if we go ahead, do you think it would be possible for you to do something like segments? Or maybe it's just a copy of segments which has an attribute for each segment, which is like with a value with a density value. Yeah, I mean, it wouldn't be difficult to create a file of that shape. I mean, that would be no problem. Would it be easier though? Because all your methods are sort of not working with their whole time frame.  instruction there. So would it be easy for you to tie the things together? Like if you're doing it on the word basis, you're with those words that in the end, you then tie it back into the right segment here. I mean, probably have to do that. Yeah, I don't know about you with your words, but for my segments with a F0 measurements and all those ways I get from there, I always store the big start and end time. Everything I calculated there.  You do have time based. So this isn't directly having time references but you can get that oh it is actually yours. Okay so if you slice it up by time you'd probably be able to just like attach like just some attribute of info valve just to each of those segments.  I don't understand enough about the data structure. It's really would be a lot easier, would I really understand how they are handling the data internally?  Then I could say it's easy to just hide in if you just have a time stamps or just reference by words and stuff. Put that at the moment. So you're doing a word by word base. Yeah, the problem is probably that I extract all the words and then I don't use an idea or something.  So it would be difficult to write it back to the right position. But every word does the word picking like this. It always has the same information value in your position. It depends on the position. And you're doing this wire some software that's like external software so you can't. Yeah, I could use another a different approach. So what if you if you if you get the results from  So if you go back over it then with that file sort of you write an algorithm which which then goes back because they're in the right order still and stuff right so that shouldn't be a problem But this is by speaker here which makes it slightly more difficult The problem is that actually night XML probably provides a lot of the tools that we need to do them I made a file that contains just the Star times it could contain n times and roots for all speakers of all meetings I mean let's just  in the temporary secret. In the temporary secret. I gave to you but just playing also starting in terms of every word so you could perhaps use it to match with your additional information you would. Yeah, what did you induce to make your file? Per, just in the transcript. You didn't use an XML password. No, no. Okay. What do you think it would make sense to just take files by speaking  It doesn't matter what input I give to Rainbow so I just could use the files as they are I don't know if that's put the information density I could still make any sense if you split them up because I mean the whole I thought the whole thing is that you look at the frequency of a word in that specific how off my word occurs in a certain topic versus how of middle-course over the whole Copperson that from that it calculates no it I think it's not versus the whole Copperson  It's you have certain categories and you measure which words have the highest information for one category. So it's the categories across each other. I think. But would you then not get the typical words for every speaker? Probably. Yeah, because you need product good ideas.  That's because... But I mean, it can't be that difficult. If you already have... You have in the right order all the words with a score to them. You have a file which has each word and a timestamp. So those two tied together have each word and it's time and... And it's value. Yeah. Yeah, what the problem is, I don't know exactly. I think the information gain in Rainbow is ordered by the value  If the information gain, not sure if I can get the right order and the values. That's the problem. So there, at the moment, if the order stays the same, it's no problem at all to just write back again. But if it's ordered by information gain, I don't know where the words come from, because it has a back of words representation. It appears to me that Rainbow was made for something quite different. Yes, it is. It was made for text classification.  So could we put our information back in there? Yeah, that's a problem. I actually sure that Rainbow is doing a measure like is returning a measure of what we are trying to measure because it seems to me that it just sounds like something quite different in what it actually does is that you you put in some documents and you have several documents per category and you have several categories  And then it measures which words are typical for a certain category. And if you get a new document it will compare which words are in that new document. And if there are a lot of words that are typical for one category it will sign it to that category and if it's typical for another one it will sign it to that one.  information from.  So you've split it up by a topic at the moment? No, I've just split them up somehow by there are several documents for each meeting. And I just put one in each category. So it's not very sensible at the moment because I'm waiting for the topic segment.  makes sense at all. But yeah, if that's just while you're waiting. OK. Have you ever looked into different ways of calculating? Because I was just thinking, like I mean, the, for example, there, there in what's it called, the entropy calculation. It's such a box that's simple calculation that you could probably write the script in no time at all. Yeah, maybe it's better if I write it myself. Because otherwise, it's too easy to just split things up into bins. It wouldn't be any work at all.  in terms of programming or something? Yeah, but I think that probably the entropy value at the moment for a word is closer to what we're at the moment looking for. I can sit together with you for 20 minutes and just show you the entropy code that I wrote from my other project. And it's probably, and we should work together because we have to use the same matrix as I'm using in my latent semantic analysis. You'd use to calculate entropy scores. And then we'd have a score which actually  which would be the same for the word in each position. So in that sense it's doing something a bit different. And basically the score that I'm talking about is a conditional entropy score which just checks how much information, the fact that there's one word tells you about what would be the next word. But that's a relatively good measure of whether that's a very specific word in which case they're usually words which tell you quite a lot or a very general word which usually doesn't tell you quite a lot. How does a calculate identity actually?  the  being the words which are least expressive in contain less information. Yeah, function versus just very general nouns, for example, the word computer in that context. You could imagine it to like be in all the context. But do we have enough enough data for that it gives us sensible things? Because I mean the words we're really looking for appear not too often and if they  I was getting that wrong. I was getting it from what I did in my project now. In this case, we would do it by per meeting.  It's probably doing quite the same thing in the end, but I'm just saying like with that thing you would easily have an algorithm which at the moment provides you for each word with a score which we can use.  from which specific topic that was. So that would, yeah, the same thing. Yeah. But that would give the same value for one word every time. I mean, for a specific word. Yeah. Yeah. Because then it would be quite easy to integrate it. Yeah. So specific word per. The same word. The word yesterday would be would have the same score all over the  All the really plays and in my case it would have different values for each category but in that category it would have the same value at each place.  We did several documents for each category. That would be best. But I would have to look at that. We did work without that at all. At least it works if there are several categories with each, with under-cumin each. So in our case, basically every topic would be better.  beats own category. The question is, does the algorithm still make any sense? I don't understand the algorithm enough for that. But because the end trificolor am calculation is so simple, maybe we should look into making that score just as a preliminary score that we have. It's a very, it gives you like, I've looked at the result, it gives you basically something in the end which vaguely tells you just whether words are very specific word or a very general word.  And I like there is some hope that probably having just sentences with us lots of very specific words. If you mark them as being more interesting, then the words which are only very general words that they would get us somewhere. And what score would work? Get that just across ones and all the core proofs for example? Probably 1.0 is very high information value. Even though there are the other same topics where  Yeah, because this would, yeah, in the sense, I mean, this is a bit like they would like document frequency over total frequency measure, it's sort of just going by. So would it be higher scored than a word that occurs in every sequence of the same topic?  I mean, we have several topics, for example, we have 20 topics. And for one of these topics, there are five occurrences. And we have one of them. Within the topic, so like, topic, when you say topic, you mean like just like from from our beginning to an end point like within one meeting, there are several topics. Yes, but across meetings, there will be the same topic several times. But we don't have that information.  Anywhere do we? Well, okay. I thought that was what you were doing. Oh, and when it splits the topics up, it does do it on regular words that. But it doesn't tell you what they are. But both of you are sick. Also, I'm segment similarity. I think that was I'm doing one on segment similarity in the end. Yeah, I'm doing like finding similar segments based on semantic analysis. But.  Like for now, like your segmentation is just splitting a meeting up into different blocks. And they are not related then to other blocks of... Not from what Collins do, from what I know. It's only that I'm writing an algorithm with it, which then tries to also again, based on word occurrence patterns, try to link together, maybe different ones of those. Okay. I misunderstood that. So... So yeah, how would it work?  what would the his information then be useful for in rainbow. I thought the point about that was that we would put into several categories all the segments of the same topic. There's nothing else that we just split. I need some way to split and that splitting out category  Yeah, I'm also a bit like I'm not 100% sure about rainbow being the right thing because it seems that rainbow does in its structure quite reliable having different examples of the same categories sort of in a way Yeah, but I think it should work for just one document because it compares between the categories and if you  just have one document. It still can find out which words are informative for that category and which are not. So if you have just one document in each category and there are a lot of occurrences of the word there in each one. So this word will be not very informative across the categories. So it should work for one, but I'm not sure how exactly it calculates everything. And I think it's not  You know what? As a byproduct of my LSA, I'll provide a vocabulary like sort of a dictionary which for each word gives an entropy score, entropy score which just tells you of how much information the presence of a word tells you about which topic it is. Not which category like I'm not lumping together separate topic segments into categories but just like how much this word tells you about how likely that would be the occurrence of that word  it makes it that it's a specific segment, topic segment, which is some measure already of how widespread this word is versus how specific to certain segment that is. And I'll just provide that because that's just not much more work than just the usual thing. And then we can see how we can tie that in with the other stuff. So if you keep on working on rainbow meanwhile and try to find a way how to tie your rainbow stuff into some way that we can add.  that shit to a certain time segment. Maybe it's possible to have a list that's all that is ordered by. Just thinking, it used is each word completely unique. Like sort of does it treat each word, each occurrence of word as a completely unique event or does it? I mean, no, it has to. Basically the form of the word is important, right? We can't just replace the word panabatory string.  Because it looks if the same word occurs again and stuff. It has to work on the word. I was thinking is whether if we replace the word by something uniquely identifiable then it would make difference which order it is but that wouldn't work because it needs the word because that's always working on it. It looks if that word occurs again and versus how often that word occurs in other contexts.  to attach some type of information to the word just to the word string itself like making an underscore making the time of something that wouldn't work. You can use some kind of truncation maybe if you attach a number to each word and say that it should omit the last part. But would it have that in the unstraintated version then would it would the output be the unstraintated version? Probably not. No, I don't think it would.  Yeah, for now I mean really just like Yeah, I think if we work together on an entropy based score, it's let me see if I can demonstrate I mean let's just keep  I'm talking about one another, try to start it up. It's a very simple thing, but it basically just does something which tells you how specific a word is. In a sense, it's basically just to a high degree really telling you how rare a word is or how common a word is. But as the first step, that's probably for a prototype, for an extra week, that's probably not a bad thing. If it's just that, even if you just like, if you have segments with words,  There are lots of rare words occur, highlighted in darker red than segments where all the very common words occur. That's just that somewhere to start from. And it's a bit more sophisticated than that. But then, de facto, it just ends up doing that mostly from what I figured out. Actually, I think I'm not gonna start that now,  So if we get it on a word by word basis, whatever you do, it'll probably be a word by word basis. What do you have on a sort of segment, but not quite a segment base? Yes. Yeah. I mean, I haven't really decided on how to really get the information out of this now because when I have, for example, increased speaker overlap,  that applies to several turns, of course. But I could give the information about how important this is to each of those segments. Okay, what about the following model? I mean, this is a very unsentific way of doing it in some sense, but what if we take time as the standard unit for now and sort of like make a massive one second split super array, because everything you're doing can in one way or the other bit tie down to actual time.  So if we if for each one second time slot we could attach a value and then it would be easy to then go back when if we have the time marks here and remap that on to on to the length of a segment, you know what I mean? So if you have for each word say and we know that word starts at this second and ends at that second and you have for like for some time period the overlap in that period on the f1's in that period or something so you also have a value which can be tied down to a time and then we could just in in matter  level and something just create some massive super array of things for each fridge. Like, sort of time sampling slot and calculate the value for this. And once we have this array, we can go with the script and sort of go for each segment to the starting and end times and say, okay, this is from our time segment, here to this time segment there. So we take the sum of those and divide them by by the number of something create the average and put it in this the value for the segment.  I mean.  and saying okay, like running it with different factor loadings and saying okay this way works this way works that well.  But I would probably be more difficult for Map for you to map it on So if I have the way you first second I would perhaps just give all the Important Yeah, you could always find out how many words down and other ones Yeah, but so you say that it's like you basically say having an array where each each cell is is one  like it's one word, the thing. And then you would map your information onto individual words. Yeah, I would say someone have to break it down. I would probably somehow have to break it down to that level. Would you be able to find out which word that is in it? Yes, sure. Okay, and then we could have like some type of just point in the end where the ones caused from all the individual  the word cells get multiplied all with like for each utterance or whatever you have get all multiplied with the same value all the ones that are within that utterance that's sort of the combination of the two scores. Yeah. And then we'd have to go back again and then put that back into that segment mode here. So that we because in the end we don't want it on a pervert basis but probably on a per segment base. Yeah. But then okay with that that moment it would be  for me to just make it on a per segment basis right way. And that's where I adapt it also to the second section. Oh yeah, actually that's true so that it's easier if you are able to, well I think that's probably back where we started it. But you said it, but you said it's more complicated because your segments aren't those segments exactly. Yeah, I mean mine are only more but they have the same stud and end point sometimes they're two segments and one with the gap in between but they have  They don't overlap. And they're segments too overlap. No, no, they don't. But those two of those don't. My segments overlap in the same way as they are stupid sometimes. I have split one of the segments into two segments, but it's easy to match the extension. So you could, on their granularity. You could, on their granularity, create a  for each of their segments.  in the XML file yet, but if we do that in the software, then we can probably make ways of playing with it in the software and sort of, you know, like adapting some sort of control, like playing around with, like, just playing with different ratings for the utterance-based one versus the word-based one and sort of look at it dynamically. You know what I mean? Like playing around sort of figuring out what's the best way of combining them by playing around, looking at the results.  difficult but yeah we could even have a look at our different measures if they come up with the same kind of yeah we could probably like make a graphic display initially at least for our experimenting which displays them in different ways and then see how they interact with each other I mean that's what I'm already doing with my okay so do you think like both of you then can map  something onto their segments, like just each of you provide one value, like double value or whatever, like one decimal value or whatever onto, onto exactly their segments. I think if I can provide something for the words as they're, it's stated from where to where the segments go, it should be. It's stated both as, even which words it is. It's done both in terms of words and in terms of sections. It's a bit sad sort of that we do this before we've truly figured  how the Nitex smell thing works because now we're doing it all by hand like parsing and unparcing that thing and it's it's all part of the framework. How much easier would it be if we truly understood this? Well, it should be quite straightforward. Some of the tasks you have to do. You know and really understands them. But actually we're XML parsing. Can I just change my order of which I do things and like forget my latency, my analysis stuff until the weekend.  and try to really make sense of the night data system now so that maybe as soon as I've understood that we find ways of doing that within the night framework already so that we don't manually have to parse times and tie things together. You mean by matching strings? Well at the moment what you would do like to solve this problem is you would sort of write some per script or something that gets this time value out of here.  So, provided that you get your words in the right order, do you think it is an easy task for you to get just a single value per segment?  those segments. And if you both able to map it to those segments, then we should be able to get one file where we have like whenever two values value a and value b both as attributes for this. And that we could load into a prototype and see what types of displays, what ways of displaying this information are there.  I hope to have some value quite soon with. I just calculated the values for the average F0s. I mean, I didn't have a look at the data yet, but they're very quietly even for the same speaker across meetings. So once speaker had an average of about 100,  There's probably also social interaction factors that sometimes just are meeting like if people adapt their zeros to each other, sometimes.  I'm not measuring the F0, the R of the robot, the variance of F0 within a certain time frame and have some parts where low variance with a more or less top and the same F0 in one way, there's a lot of more variance. I don't know about that.  and have now a considerable amount of time to relate to our meetings because we have 75 hours per average of 6 speakers and they measure every 0.016 seconds and it gives us kind of a way.  The F0 is relative to the average for the speaker or yeah, what I did at the moment is I Yeah, I got the F0 values from for each speaker for his headphone and I only take those That that were required at the time where he was actually speaking and for those I calculated the average  me now one value per speaker permitting. Okay. So would you would be feeding in would be just like one value per speaker permitting. So that's your average baseline. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That makes, yeah. That makes a lot more sense. Yeah. So that would show you how much relative to how he's sort of how he's performing generally in that meeting relative to that how he's in a specific segment.  Yes, I mean I just needed to have this way to relate Yeah, and for you that would be quite easy to translate into those segments Because I'm gonna take that and source Yeah, I mean I actually have to look at the data what causes these Because it's quite funny to me  I have a male speaking at 200. They do exist. They castratikor of the National Computer Science Institute. I'm afraid I have to go soon. But not quite sure. I mean, is there anything more we have to talk about anyway? Maybe if we meet the weekend. Yeah. See, as soon as we meet the weekend,  As soon as I'm halfway through my LSA, like basically as soon as I have the Matrix build of the document by word stuff, it's very easy to then calculate for each word a score and I can just give you those scores and you can do them whatever you want.  on the Java stuff in it and we'll just see whatever you would ever use supply as we try to tie in and visualize them somewhere or another. I'll ask Jonathan if we can postpone the meeting to one o'clock. So that would give us a chance of meeting for an hour before that to discuss the questions that we had. Yeah, you just sent us an email and tell us what's happening. Yeah, I haven't gotten like sort of my confirmation that when  I'm not sure if I'm supposed to expect a confirmation from a confirmation from him now or that's just email him again and ask him if he can maybe make it one sorry reset 12 and I'm asking if he can make one This is a bit frustrating at the moment. The project is not as so like Difficult to get to the point where you understand enough to really feel that I don't know I'm not feeling that I'm really working at the moment. I'm not just trying to make sense  and I met the moment feeling round of my data and not quite seeing how I get to a sense of an abstraction level, you know? From my memory. I guess as soon as we have a framework in the type of the prototype where like sort of each of us can tie in there stuff and see how it looks like and how it performs, you know, that probably makes it a lot easier than but it's a bootstrapping problem. Like for the prototype we need some type of data but to develop the data it would be a lot easier to have the  I mean, you will be happy with some data even if it doesn't make much sense. Yes, but if it's in a form which is used to read in at the moment, that would be fine. So I'm like, if basically if we have something like this segments file, but for each of you like just have one attribute, I think it's really easy if we don't merge them beforehand, but if we let them, if we combine them in the prototype or don't at the moment, because then we can easily display them individually, contrast them to each other and play a  with how to combine them. And also we don't have to recalculate it just. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm in computationally multiplying two integers, the doubles or whatever shouldn't be the thing that's not too much. Yeah. All right.  you  I am.  Okay  like an option so play where it should be. Yeah, no, it's just like sort of like preparing people for it looks like it looks like really nothing. It looks like basically less than their stuff. But actually Dave has written a whole underlying different structure now. And if we hook it up with my display, then we should fairly easily from now get to a stage where we can like select individual segments and click on them and then play that part in a compressed way and display density information. Now at the moment the application is which  Yeah, so at the moment we have a dialogue act window and the graphic and display. I'm not sure. The interesting thing is the sound came when I tried it last time after I I triggered off something by clicking on something. Yeah, they're suddenly they come probably they're just slow and loading and they don't know if the buttons yet. Yeah, so at the moment the display is still  your data I'm not going to show you. It probably looks like where a state from the looks of it. The segments are made up at the moment, but the code's there for integrating real segments. And this is summarized based on just where a state at the moment from some part of the meeting. So we're not loading the whole thing at the moment yet properly. But the important thing is this is summarized based on, I realized I was pointing at my screen and you don't see. So this stuff is summarized based  on these intensity measures. And we don't have to exact audio record for this. It's really set up to just copy it. So just to show Dave has put a music file in there. And the music file is playing without gaps. That's because the way how we handle it at the moment is the Dave prepares an audio file, creates an audio file dynamically from just the chunks that you want to have. And that runs in sync with what we have in the...  I'm making loud, it's just... So we see that running along with the playing of the music, we see the Halle de D'Alog Act. That's pretty good. You can also control click on the dialogue apps and it will play that section in the file as well. Okay.  So, and that already, this party already is dynamically created. So let's just load it with the Jasmine set, it's just to see a difference. Where's it? So which version of my data was at the very first one? Quite a whole. We were like doing this, we were just concerned with the whole. Yeah, I mean, where it doesn't matter. It's one day, where, what am I looking for? I'm looking for a data manager, where am I looking for?  Is it whether the file names are that here? Is it here where words important file? No, it is on your display Where it calls which one to get you just need to change the flag in my display I think it must be unless I pass you it How do you do the summary? Yeah, you can change it for in the summary when the summary is called in  So are you basing it on certain specials? Okay, so what did you say? It makes the summary. It's the best place to do it. I mean, you know where that is just about? It'll be above that. Again, down is going to be after the date of the date of the date of the date. In this main, in this routine,  There's something great importance with the zero and there's read word importance with the one Yeah, let's hop those around it. Maybe it'll be in some reconstructor Then Yeah, try some reason what's the different so this is read the minters separate arrays and then you can change your flag to select which one it gives back  just swap the phandoms around for now. Yeah, if you want. Or would that crash anything? That should fire. Oh yeah, and we really leave a zombie we have to fire. We'll be in the air. I should make a new construct so that let's you send the flag. So you have time this afternoon? Yeah. Yeah. So here. So this shows, if we see anything at all, then we see it  moment at least that we are definitely having a different summary just because we're having a different important measure. So you see that it does something like at the moment I think this was. Yeah, yeah, that's an old old old version. So it shows. So if you think about how the old version happened, then you see it make sense that words like, profited, just like a thing if that was the only utterance that that probably scored quite well and stuff.  I have to get this button, Steve. Yeah. It's weird online. Probably all these who's and I have a spider friendly in there. Yeah. I think that's the problem. Should generalize. Unfortunately, I didn't get the bar on the display working just yet. But that should be a small one. That's a very old one, rather.  things those SS and ease and so on the single letters are because of the problem with my. Yeah, no, this is very old. We should never call the chart. It's tough because we were working on. So we see that we have a very different density curve as well for this one. And yes, so from here we go and it hopefully won't be too difficult to now first of all put the right segments in put a sliding bar into this so that people see where they are. So I'm constantly touching stuff on my screen.  and then make selections based on a segment. Now, would we know quite sure is what's the best way for how the summarizer works? Should it always compress a segment to a constant length or by a constant factor of time? Or what would you think? If there's a certain degree of summarization, what should be the constant?  So always like a relic so it should always whatever reduce it to half the rest of it more sense yeah Because on alternative you would be that yeah, well I guess that could be a doubt Yeah, well I guess that could be a doubt Yeah, because on alternative you would be that you could sort of make it that it always is the same length So if you like if the whole meeting is selected it compresses the whole meeting to five minutes then if one segment one topic is selected then  It's a little bit less controlled over.  to do most of that they can index serums. I need to do some changes to the program manager to be able to handle. Yeah, I think what basically why I need it is the list of words with an index to start with. Reach meeting or under index. It's supposed to do a really matter as long as you're unique and it can I can pass them back to you.  Should we abandon the whole notion of seeing the whole one-hole group is one single thing and just work on it? Certainly for now and probably for good that means. I mean, I did you want, you know, I just got there for one meeting. Are you needing more at the moment? Well, from the point of us developing it, it doesn't really make much difference. Do we have everything for the same meeting at the moment?  Are you all working on the same meeting? Yes, I think we're all using the first one. Did anyone ever check if that's actually a good meeting like, or comparably to others? I think it's segment quite well though, first one. So you want to send the prototype and we should change the data with the rest? I'm sorry, the only problem with the first meeting is  that there is no hot spot annotation for that. But I mean that's not a real problem. Do you take it from my directory or do I have to put it in there? Well at the moment it's just an old file. Yeah but would you take it from my directory or?  I don't think I'm going to be able to do the speech tools through Java native-owned vase because the documentation for the mis-herrific is really bad. I think I'll just write out a script with the system called. Yeah. Yeah. I just don't think it's worth wasting too much time on it. Yeah, it's not really important. We get it missing cleaner in a  Yeah, especially because I mean that's that's that's only done like once every time the selection changes, right? So even if you sort of even if you do an hourglass at that moment, you know, even if it pauses for 10 seconds, well, that's tough like that. I think we should just make sure that if it takes quite some time that the clock doesn't start before whether the audio on the clock or anything sort of so we just start. Yeah.  Yeah, there's a wait for command for an external call to make sure that the external thing is finished because in general like that sort of running parallel. I think yeah I Have some code for system calls like the handles Dean and the output if you need some of that Okay, really, because I'll just dump out a temporary file  I don't really know what to talk about. See, there's one week after my dissertation, so before the presentation of the prototype, which I can work a lot, a lot of this, that's good. I think we should decide what we want it to actually look like in the end.  Because are we going to have some kind of tree view to represent the meetings and stuff? Because if we're not, then we probably have to make the graphical display display a bit more information. Yeah, well, the graphic display will definitely have more information. If we're at the moment abandoning the concept of displaying  the whole series of meetings just because it's for us like more bureaucracy more complexity and it probably just won't give us any brownie points to the presentation. But do you think it will am indeed? I think it might work because Steve laid quite a lot of weight on surfing through meetings. So we should at least provide an overview of different meetings of one group.  It's not too difficult to do in a sort of a hack kind of way. We can just treat it all. It's one meeting. Yeah. Yeah. And then maybe have some basic information. Like if I would just create like a hard segment at the start of end of each meeting like once a red instead of black or something like that. Yeah. So just a little bit of addition information.  the display that knows we're meeting, picking it over and otherwise into an movie treated. Like so we have continuous IDs for the segments. Yeah, that works. Yeah, but apart from that we don't really do anything different as a picture from meeting. Yeah, I completely agree. So the only thing is would be that the display gets information about where they are and displays them as hard boundaries.  So, I think that was planned at the beginning, wasn't it? Yeah, so initially I thought it was sort of more a search functionality that simply there's one button that says find similar segments and then in the same display where we display the search results from the search.  I'm not sure if you think displaying an information about similarity to the selected meeting in the other segments. I'm just coming back to an initial idea of presenting all the similar segments across meetings and separating by some. No, I think that's, I really don't want to do that to be honest. It would be nice, but like to  to do it in the summariser. Yeah, but it should appear as a continuous thing for the payer continuous on the display. Yeah. Well, I'm not sure if it's worth much bother though. Like if we do a similarity search and just like you say, find me similar segments and then sort of like you have a list and you click on one of them and then you go to that segment. I think that's quite useful even without displaying them sort of discontinuously.  So how we can display the search results? Well, I was thinking of just like really just a more or less just imagine those are search results each like each of them sort of giving whatever we should aim to get some names for segments like just some extraction of something that we can call and if it's just a single highest Importance measure or phrase of a segment so that we have something to display for them like basically just a summarization down to one segment and it would just be a list like this and you click on  one and then the whole bureaucracy kicks in like this gets the notification. And then we could use the same thing for yours and mine because yours would give just the segment IDs and mine would give the start segment IDs. So basically this display would have information about a segment where something starts.  Maybe also something else like for mine and some string that we passed to describe what it is. You waited your search for what it returned, would it return just the specific? It would go right to the utter end, right?  the other.  If you can pass me like the dialogue act with Yeah, whether the speaker to be have them with this speaker at the moment. Well with the speaker ID Yeah, that should be enough. You know that because you've not could create a file with the speaker IDs and speaker names. Oh, yeah, just wrap it up. I have that file. Yeah, I did that as well as the player is in the group. Yes in the D. R. Yeah, speak with D.  Yeah, the data manager should be quite well documented. So you should be able to use that. Very search, quite easily. Yeah. So what about... Sorry, could I use that? The moment it's ready to get dialogue out from the dialogue at that level. I've not got it reading in the topic segments yet.  So what about a general layout like this that we have here the dialogue acts and the player and here we'd have a search button and the similarity thing button. I mean we can put the search results.  question. If we move everything to the right a little bit, make a little bar on the left. Yeah. Yeah. Like, search a lot. Yeah. I think we probably like, we can leave those like eye frames and just arrange them sort of. Yeah. We'll basically we'll get something to print out their locations. So we'll arrange it. I'll turn it typically. We'll have like the whole thing running already when we do the presentation and we just arrange it manually. My squad easy to do.  Apparently Microsoft sometimes or like listen the past the demonstration whether just exactly new which five to ten of the system we're working That's what we're gonna do as well. Yeah Does anyone ever seen anything from the other group?  If anything we build in a time bomb that only fails if the date is the date of the presentation. Yes, because we are nice people. If this rate thing, do we have any direct control to that or is that just directly controlling how fast it plays and sort of we can only?  We're slowing down the audio but speeding up. That's a pity because it looks like it's doing something You have to pause did you overtake that code from the original? Yeah, but also speeding up the oh, the same component that does that Do you think if we override that component and just override whatever the action to that slide power is? No, we don't look in that code and see what actually does  It's really bizarre it slows it down but the speed up doesn't seem to work. Yeah maybe it has a different constructor. Also they're gross powder breaks terrible. Well yeah it shouldn't be minus two times it should be half. Because that'd be buying it backwards twice as quickly. So if something like they're skipping would have actually co-prepared without system at the moment would our  skip automatically forward  I think the simple that we get that you can just like pass things into and then check when they got clicked really Something that might be quite cool is if you could You know like some applications when you open a file you get like a little preview If we could do something like that it displays like a five-line summary  We couldn't do summer, I know then we would have to over summer.  one or two best utterances for each segment would be really worthwhile. For the search results, I probably think that instead of a simple summary, something that displays the utterance where the word was like displays in a highlighted form where it was found. Another quite good thing might be, how easy is it?  on the search result. You could give it each one a tool tip that had the context like the options before the options itself and the options after. Yeah, it would be nice when you hold the values right now. Alternatively, we could always have sort of a third small component, whatever. Like if this was the search result, and then it's just like something else that's parked under it. And when mouse goes over this one, it triggers that one to display or something. Yeah, if we can get the tool tip. Now, tool tip is a thing of fairly straight thinking. It should be quite easy. Yeah.  Especially with a preview, we'll be able to get two tip fairly simply because it's just a property of it. Yeah, that's what we saw. I've never seen two tips displaying several lines and stuff, so I wonder how good that look, but we can try that. It's quite common in some applications, really. So far, only seen two tips of a few words length. But yeah, that should be fairly easy.  We have a moving band, the graphic I display that moves according to the... Yeah, we will have that actually it's gonna happen today and we will have proper segments as well. Is that quite easy to do here? A moving question. The thing I'm like I have to find out how to do it without redrawing the display each time because the display at the moment does take, you see like it takes a fraction of a second to display but probably too much to update it to completely repaint the whole thing every  second so at the moment I'm just whenever it needs to be repainted I'm not thinking about what to do in chest repainting the thing as a whole with a moving bar that's not a good idea but until I think of something better what I'll just do is I'll just I'll probably not have a moving bar the whole length but just some indicator somewhere like whatever just a triangle moving at the bottom for now or something then I can just like repaint a small area or something  Yeah, I have to find I have to find out the commands for like really just redrawing a small small piece. I have to just there's examples for doing stuff like that. I just have to read up on it, but yet displaying there the current position bar will be easy provided that my whole calculations of like where we are in time here are all  correct. I mean that's just something that is in test so far. But it should be. So the general concept will you just keep on working on improving the information density measures? Do you think there will be a point when you say, well that's it. We have an information density score and we'll be looking  for something else to do or? I'm pretty sure that I can always find something to improve there. So, I mean, if you need me to work on something else, I can try to finish my stuff early. But otherwise, I can still keep working on it, improving it, I think. Well, I don't actually add the moment.  see how many people can work on the programming anyway? Right now it probably won't be much benefit. No. So now I've finished all the meetings I think there's not that much to do unless I get some evaluation method that could be quite difficult and we'd have to tag some part of it or something. Because if I can't evaluate I can do any better.  I guess I mean  before we wrote the report. And then he came back with his own criticism saying like, oh, you didn't say anything about my violation. And then everybody did the last trip. We said we're not going to go. Oh, but now I expected it in more detail. And if that translates to 80%, like if those actually translate to to really like their percentage score, then that would be good. I think they did exhaust the first 60% or 16% or 16%. I thought like the 30% age.  They were 40% each and this is how they became 60%? How much do you think they were? We're also it just means that he's relatively lenient because I mean the reports were I think they were good reports but like probably somebody else wouldn't have said they were excellent so that's a good sign that shows that he's not hell bent on  And then you'll see the final display and you realize that it was all fake that we didn't make it anywhere. I think we'd ramped the undressed way. It had a long-term integrity. So the thing is, like for me personally, I think a lot of work will be done in the last minute in this specific case. That's not a new statement in general, but  Like the week just before the presentation I have most of the stuff that I'm doing now I'm rid of it including the dissertation and deal  It's a bit... Yeah, I kind of nicked the idea that he went about called LL and went on for guitar temperature. I love the guitar, actually. I think it might have been off more like a chase, I think it's going to be quite hard. Yeah, we just have to do it. Music, notation and stuff. Well, Tabs doesn't usually have music, notations. Right. Pit, gym, formation, rock, and it's not some part. See how far I get anyway.  So, Jasmine, if you got something like this and like this for always your current data, would that help in sort of have been promising this for a week now, realize I'm gonna keep. I don't know if it's that. It might be a help. Because essentially at the moment, it's pretty much it should be a question of copying it over it, right? It's just too easy to come online parameter. It's not essential though, I think.  It can probably add an open file dialog box with minimal method because I think it's already made component that returns the string for a file name. It may even return a file directly or that. Yeah. So we can do that today. Probably. Yeah. The thing is, I don't know, it doesn't really make sense to call it file open or anything like that because it's more like an option.  Yeah, but why don't we read everything just from one file? Yeah, and I sure it would not necessarily need to be a part of the final thing, but why don't we just provide some means even if it does it automatically in the beginning as a startup option just to ask for a file name, because then we can just publish a script that you just run and then this whole thing starts. You know what happened to me today? Like I forgot about the web. I'm not sure if he had that problem before finding  the Java media, the Java X media stuff, all the charts. Yeah, I was like suddenly panicking the 11-minute real-life sketch. I thought it would be very straightforward to get it going here. And then I got that thing. Yes, so if we do a work which automatically opens up a file open box. You're automatically producing the right format with this, with just per utterance.  So would it be easy slash just a difficult session possible like at the moment if you skip to a Treating a whole serious as one thing so like creating one file for the whole serious that gives the address the ideas from top to bottom and Or even just the entire corpus that's what?  I think we should go for like for one group not for the whole corpus.  the IDs  I like that one meeting then. The main data that's just uniquely numbered throughout the entire corpus. We'll add the moment from the dump file. It's just got the uniquely numbered throughout the entire corpus. The entrances. Okay, and that makes more sense to do that anyway because that means you got more flexibility with how you want to create them and one thing you really don't want is  ever to have two entrances that could potentially have the same ID. But it just doesn't make sense in the logic why sort of like until here it's the meeting about this thing and then it's that thing and then it's this like where's that's the point of the data. Could we just take the name each each dialogue act meeting dot dialogue number would be a longer name but  that's not really much point. Because at the moment it's got quite nice prophecy that dialogue at number also coincides with the array index number in the array of dialogue acts. Maybe we're talking like so. So your data manager would that then handle the whole thing? Would that handle it? This would only like to display would only display one group. You could choose whatever you wanted. Yeah, so if I mean, I don't mind where it's done. So if the data manager filters it out and like,  I just think that in the logic of the program, it's much easier to justify why we say we treat a series of meetings. It's one single thing rather than...  I would just I would find logical reasons for why you can just say just good practice like it separates the data from the program logic what you're talking about doing is embedding some of the program logic in the data But I see there's two commonly like def like I see each each group is completely separate  that Brett Martis data that shouldn't be forcing on the ease of when we don't have to. But would it still, like, would we still, in the logic of it, still have continuous IDs if we say we take just one meeting? Would the display, for example, still be able to just say, I want from whatever, from the first and to the last and everything in between sort of end. And the data manager would then display that just for that meeting. Okay, well, if that's possible, yeah.  If you currently got continuous IDs for your top segments. I've only done the first meeting. I've only done all of them. And for the top segments. Yeah, sorry for the top segments. The other ones is that you've just got one meetings so far. But the idea was it would be tenuous. I think everything should be like that, continuous and chronological order. Is that what you've got because different meeting series overlap?  For example, if they're not F0 values for every speaker or sometimes not for ever meeting, will I count that up?  Okay, at the moment I don't even generate any document for those. But because, I mean it's not zero, it's just a no.  Yeah, that's what we're all set. So you you'd also say that it shouldn't be part of the importance measure if there's no zero. Yeah. Well, I don't know how we're going to do the fusing of the different important measures anyway. If that's done in the program or if that's done offline,  I think it's done in the program. It's probably going to stop on. There's anyone have a good idea, like at the moment to play around with it, what's a good way of displaying two types of information in the color display? I mean, there's probably logically ways like if one is whatever, if one is the darkness and the other is the redness or something, is anyone ever experimented with sort of displaying two-dimensional information in color, because then we could do adjustments and wear us probably in the same scale.  Green and Blue to just weigh up the three. Do we really want to display them separately? Because we need one. No, for now, for us. It might be interesting to hear that just the word important. Yeah, but then the user would have to know about what was what and what contributed to the blue stripes and what contributed to the human ones.  But I think probably for us like in developing it it would be interesting. Yeah, so I'll try the red green blue. What does anyone know about this hue and saturation thing like what that? Nobody's not much color work. I don't know how to do job. It's not a problem of doing it like I think the trouble is that you use a very sensible scale like it comes up to like red two or three times.  Okay, well I guess I'll just take a look at the Photoshop color cube or whatever it is, give it color cube and look at... Oh, you could just split it into two blocks I suppose for now. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so we'll produce a version of this which opens up with a dialog box where you can select a file  Is that right? Will you be able to do that? And then you'll get this type of display with that file. And that's at the moment. So we are still talking about using that one meeting that everyone is using now. We talked about swapping now. It's a data set for it. So everyone should produce stuff for the whole corpus now.  Okay. We need the explicit information about each meeting then like sort of from which utterance to which utterance it goes and stuff. Yeah, well, it's not reading that in yet, but that will be part of the data manager as well. Is anyone access classes all defined? Is anyone providing that at the moment? Does anyone know your file?  Okay, okay, can we can we red one program that calculates all the For all our different contributions to the importance measure the absolute? Dialog act numbers for the meeting Because at the moment we all produce the numbers for each meeting separately with you  I need my name for the next number 3. Yeah, but we should all use the same program, I think. But prevent us from having too much mistakes in it. Or at least the mistakes would be consistent.  I'm not sure about that. As a night, I just don't understand much about how difficult it is to do to do it differently.  and smashers and... We can actually let the numbers. As long as everything is in the right order it shouldn't like we should even be able to just ID it when we're reading it in. Well we have got the index for converting from bearers ID's to your service should be a problem. Yeah, I've done that for the correlation as well so that was quite easy to do.  Have you got that for? No, it's just for one meeting at the moment. Yeah, I've got the indexes for all of the meetings. Yeah, so if we email out a script on how to load it. So yours put always, like yours would always be loaded in, I guess,  like there would only be one version of your data and you can set it over right the version if you want but you wouldn't have a file open dialog box for that then. No, I don't think so. That's what I meant. It's a bit pointless having it as file open so it'll be out playing those files. All the times more sense would have it as an option. What would the option be? I just see you can configure the location of all the files as an option but when it starts up it should just read them from the default  Okay, but like so make it an option which one it displays or which one it uses for the summarization or Yeah, that makes that was just things so that both Chapman and where I could And see their data working of course. There's no reason why we can't make a development version that displays both Has to win our trans windows and Two graphical displays. We know obviously you don't have to pick which one to sync the clock So that's not getting too much  to add another dialogue app window is really easy. So we would have like each of those components for for chasmine and wearer. I like to say if you could make a change to your things so it could display like it in two halves like the top half. Yeah. The bottom half the other. Yeah. Or maybe three actually. Maybe top half one.  but not the other and the third one and the average we can change the parameters for and then yeah I could easily make it through up three different dialogues. Would that not require three clocks and but that doesn't have to but that also means I've allia 18 a day to okay because the dialogue the display also gets information about like the relative  if in the absolute time so that would be convenient if that's just one of that because otherwise it's getting messy. So why don't we just make a swap in? Why don't we make a switch instead like? Oh no, no, it's still good because I don't want to do like three like three internal times. So that's just getting messy. Well I guess really I mean alternatively why don't we go for the simplest thing. Just create three scripts or two scripts.  Which load a parameter of common land parameter which is which file to load and then it's just there. Hold on. Yeah, it wouldn't need three internal times goes because only one sings a clock. Okay, and the others are all absolute Real-time aren't they that's what's displayed on that the bar is real-time isn't it? Yeah, so they would all be in the same times go. Okay, would the others? Oh, you just have three summarizes and then they all synced up with  one clock. The other one is just a static dialogue act as a box. Okay. So we have three color displays like three or I mean not in the final version. No, no, sure. Or maybe just start with just two like without even combining them in any sophisticated way. Just two. Yeah.  Okay, shall we wrap that up? Sorry, I'm imposing. How easy would it be to like as we can add all the true numbers of them? You mean discontinuous? I like different measures to the display. If I have to do it like flexibly then I probably then it will not be significantly more difficult. But is it worth any effort though? I mean that's the thing.  like an hour or something. It's not worth it. Because we'll never have more than two and we'll never have, well, we'll either have one or two, so in the end. Because you don't have different versions of, well, I guess you probably would have. But then also we'd have to find more sophisticated ways of loading it. Specifying the parameters so that might last easy because one can type any number of the parameters. Yeah, but that we would, so we'd have to have some  dialog box for opening stuff. It might take half an hour in the display, not more than that. It might take a minor addition to the date, and the summarise it, but it's more or less ready to go away. But it might, I think it might not really be worth it, to be honest.  just if there's a adjustment script and a error script and they each can load their stuff and see their data in the thing. They can see it summarized by their data and the other one is the static one. That should be fairly easy to do right. If I just double the display and you make a non-synced up second dialogue acts and then they can tune their mesh  I think it would be cool if we could check the night clock code or whatever code it is for this component and see if we can access those right things and do something useful for them and get notified when they change and stuff. We could just make that right. It's been something completely different. Just disconnect it from whatever it's doing. Yeah, I think have that set the length of the summary or something like that.  Yeah, I think that's what we should do. So the thing is, it's probably an easy task to read that rate, but it's probably more difficult to get an event automatically when it's changed. So that's why we might have to extend night clock and like override the function that react to that. Like the rate is probably a property which in the worst case we'd have to set public, but if we want to react to it being changed automatically, we might have to. It doesn't react to it being changed automatically.  So they haven't stopped it. Okay. Yeah, so it shouldn't like you may if we have to extend night clock a minute should just be a matter of changing one single method in it. Yeah, I mean, just disconnect it from whatever it sends the media player and connect it up to our summarizes and it's different than the summaries. Yeah. Because like we could make that not even have like a real  So meaning just put like max and min and the user can just like the same between Where is that? I was actually telling them what he actually means. Yeah, we could just if there are all sorts of stuff like that in the plantation by saying we deliberately try to keep any complexity and numbers and stuff away from people I think that's sort of a line we should go by in general sort of saying yeah, we could have done so many  You don't want to confuse people. We give people something simple and colorful where something is moving and where they don't have to deal with any numbers or text or anything like that for that matter. In fact, that's why we've given you a picture of a dog sitting in a field instead of a meeting browser. It is nice and it comes people down. So what kind of change will you pose in the summarization? Because if we find you, you know,  According to that and it's not finished. It doesn't make any sense.  So it's some kind of slash old eddies. Yeah. So, okay. Yeah. Shall we meet in an hour or so, Dave? We're probably going to eat something. I was going to go to the gym about three. Okay, I was actually planning the same, but we won't get so much done before three. That's the thing. To be honest,  I can like until three make sure that I have all the display. Yeah, sure. Yeah, we can meet at five and I have the display code ready by then which does the stuff like like having a bar  where the position isn't stuff. And I meet say five, two, seven, that should be an halftime. Yeah. Because yeah, it's much quicker of both working separately, I think. Because when we've been working together, I've just not got a lot done. Yeah, that's true. I'm like, when I go home, I'll spend like the same amount of time and get loads done. Yeah. Yes, so we can meet in five and Apple at five and Apple in Tower and just work on. So I have  I have made sure that my display does all this stuff we've been talking about until then. And then we'll put those things together.  the searching tracks with the rest. So that's not something that Colin should just do in his own.  I have had to do anything but it's a problem.  Which form would you like to  Can we not give up?  you  Oh  you  I'm not 100% sure but I'm not having crashes at the moment. So what I'm having is So we had a we had a long problem about not finding out why the time sinking up between the relative time in a sort of inner you know summarize section and the absolute times didn't correspond and stuff and we found it was some stupid Well at the moment our best guesses that it was some stupid Java thing about if you if you actually if you have two objects and you say object  If you say A equals B, it's actually referenced to the same thing. So any changes you make to one are made to the other. And if you do that around five corners, you lose track of it. And you suddenly wonder why that value is zero. And it turns out it is zero because it's the same thing that you, anyway, so we figured out. It's interesting. Why don't I have a screen here now? That's new, but that's OK. It's doing different things all the time. This is the first time that actually. But that should be OK. That should be OK. I'll be able to.  Yeah, but last time I pressed that he combination everything went wrong and I think I'll be able to do just fine on the screen So that'll probably keep me from pointing on my screen which I usually it might just be at this point like there's sometimes a point loading not usually that long well, let's see Anyways, so let's just see what happens at the end we did get it  Yeah Yeah See now having a complete mess of like split Split screens and stuff. I think last time Yes, but that's not what we wanted it so but I think if I this is a log out commandant usually it resets this Amazing strange color combinations. I see in front of me at the moment  We somehow always get it working with different ways every time. So that kept us basically from doing anything else product for quite some time in the last days because we were hunting down that stupid era. I got it fixed in the last whatever one hour or something, but so at the moment the program was sort of in between working and not working because we've done lots of changes to try what the era  was. Dave, I think actually that the summary at the current moment isn't working 100% correct, but that could be because of the input data. It seems to just take the first utterance is more or less. Like if you if you first if you read through the summaries, they read suspiciously fluent like as in people's questions and answers. And then if you plot them on the screen where where they are at the moment, they seem to own which date is as well.  So maybe that's where the problem is coming from. Yeah. This is about shifting around your laptop to think that's get some less sloped on the screen. So I'm not really sure what this meeting is about to do this.  I'm going to show this just what we have at the moment, but it's not going to look very different from what we had last time. Don't ask me what happened to the promise that you will get your script where you can use your own stuff, because actually that was sort of ready, but then we started trying to get something more working and then we got into big problems. So at the moment, again, we should be at a state where people can load their own. I've got time now. I'm going to let a couple of days out these here. It's just too busy last week. Things are at the moment. It's just really bad.  for me, but from Monday on I can just do 24 seven for this one until it's due, but until Monday it's going to be really bad. Like I can probably help people if they have problems with getting getting what we have running now, but yes, yeah. Okay. So I'll just start it up what we have now and then we can talk about what different people have and stuff.  It doesn't look great. It doesn't look great. It doesn't look great. Yeah, it doesn't. But sometimes you have to take whatever you get and just see how far that gets you. That's really weird. It's just like creeping out of the way. So it's perhaps in the meantime, talk about the numbers.  We assigned to the dialog acts because I didn't know that you left out those who don't have words. So I just extracted the actual dialog numbers and the problem is it's perhaps more dangerous to get mistaken with all those numbers and not knowing why things happen if we just develop numbers and make new  Yeah, sure, but I mean for all those measures that are based on words, I can ultimately just throw those where it's nothing but those dialects like 33 in the first meeting. They have a duration, even though they don't have a word. So for my other measures,  I get them and I don't I mean I would have to look for every single Right program that looks for everything and I'm gonna test the mapping for that. Yeah, there's index miles already. Was that in the raw text index directory? Yeah, why is it to mark between the different IDs?  So that solved the problem basically? Yeah, I just wondered why do you think it's necessary at all to rule that? Because the whole program works on them being numbered at the moment. And it's a problem with theirs now. There'd be a lot of work for really no extra feature gain as well. But actually I think there is something in the audio, shouldn't there? Even though there's no word, I think in the audio  So you cut it out.  If they're in, they're like, what the ones that have no words and then not have really low information density or something. Because the thing is, it depends if we want to have it display the whole thing at once. Because you'd reckon that you could leave them in and they would never show up in a summary anyway. If you left them in, they wouldn't affect the way the program works.  Why do we have a special ending for those?  If you just write the programming the way that even in the way that it displays everything It still leaves those out like if you give those a special information density idea or if you just put it back Yes something like that and then just make sure that summary even in the in the most summarized mode just never puts them in might be a problem for me at the stage right now because I based everything on not having those  What I also did was having two people annotate the first meeting and so they didn't annotate the spaces and everything would mess up I think if I had spaces for the new values So when I wanted to do correlation it wouldn't work anymore. So I don't know. Okay, so maybe we should leave them out then  I could do is work further with what I've got now and then just when I have my final formula ready I could apply it to the new stuff. So now how did you assign the Dellocac number? Did you take the one you found in the  I just put it there or did you know my you know what my TF idea of the space on Colin's data so Okay, you and I was here. Yeah, it is actually this it is jumping now. Sorry Yeah, it's summarized just it's summarized stupidly, but at least it's jumping  Yes, and in fact at the moment I don't even know which of the two I'm summarizing over. Do you know? I'm sorry. So at the moment the configuration is that. We're an important file is test three and TDIDF file is test two. I've just switched them around. I have no clue what we're actually doing at the moment. Those names are missing. Well, the TF IDF. Yeah, especially since it's just completely missing. Especially since I've just switched them around anyway. But that's okay. By the way, I read a paper which may  It's an important point about combining two things of that type. It's basically going all about this fancy-conquered sheometric mean which effectively just means multiplying them. But I have some good information about different ways how you can sort of wait two different factors. Because it's for something very similar. Somebody who tried to solve a very similar problem where they also had two factors, they wanted to weigh them together. And there is like a good justifyable reason why we should do this  and how we can then with the simple parameter at chance, how much one weighs, how much the other weighs. So there is something for putting them together in a relatively simple way, but still a way that we can sort of justify. We can quote stuff on that. Yeah, shall we? No, it's multiplying them. And like putting them one over the power of something and the other over minus one, one minus the power of something. And they've plotted some graphs about like where they show like one going from zero to the one and the other going to zero to one.  and how the landscape changes, how the parameter changes, how it works. So it's quite good. So that's probably seeing that we're probably not going to go into any whatever base, blah, blah, blah, macro model, blah, blah, about combining them. That's probably what we can go at. This is still not ideal at the moment, David. It's sort of it's overrunning like it. It's okay. So at the moment we are that far that if I now click onto  A segment here. Yeah, it's just, sorry, I just resize it a bit. Yes, it's like the value is a sort of hard coded for the screen sizes and dies in my screen smarter. So let's see, I was a stupid user and was clicking on this segment. We probably have to make the segment lines a lot bigger. So then I did I get a new summarization. Yeah, I didn't actually see. So let me click a different one. Yeah, so you see it's a different text. And you see  It's running through it and also you see the indicator in where VR is jumping So it's skipping stuff now I don't think the summary at the moment is what we wanted to be seeing the words like oh and mmm, and exactly exactly right sure The seems probably this is again probably the opposite of what we wanted for me some value that you have to like divide by one one divide by the value something But yes, but also every other word in that sentence we  should look at our probably in your list of 50, at least, Portland words in the universe. So it's probably just because if you look at the other one, this is just their best sentence for having function words in a row and every other. I mean, this one is sort of developing a big infrastructure. Maybe it's just doing it randomly at the moment. I don't know. But we have some summary working and has good basis to start from. If I promise now that you'll get something where you can  So, I think this one over-rentious before, so we might still have some problem here that it's not stopping at the end. So, Dave, can you make the promise to you that I'm not making the promise realistically that the girls will very soon get out of the first thing or do is make a load box for selecting.  and the script that sets the class bar. So it can be there. It's just the script. The class bar is like this long. So at the moment, I've hard coded it to just taking 1-10 of the number of utterances which were in the original selection. But we'll have parameters of that. Yeah. It actually gives you an error if you put it to 20 because there's some things in there which are shorter than 20. And if you select those, then it's having a need to add some sanity checking and some of it. Yeah.  I think like a proportionally one is probably no bad idea. That's I mean an absent length is sort of a bit strange because that means that some other answers will not be changed in length and we had that discussion before and I'm confused myself about what I think about it. So the fact that this is going on beyond that green line here is something that's not ideal, but that's something we've just sort of out. But this is working in general. Does anyone have a general overview over the whole time issue like as in what date is it today? What date do we have?  I have presented what day of the week is that and issues like that. So the presentation is now- The presentation is exciting in two weeks. Two weeks from today. Okay. One week from today, I shall hear the freedom ring from the hills and everything and shall then throw myself into news slavery. I think we should start to think about evaluation.  I mean if you want to have some people Yeah, but it's just three days between the presentation and the no really yeah, and the report Yeah, I can write people in I think we should take the time because I think it will be  before hand I think we can probably manage to actually do it in the three days after. So you're talking about it. But we also have to write the thing in that time. Writing the report won't be so bad. How long is it expected to be? I don't know. It's 50% of the mark. I know but if everyone is managing three pages for their bit then that's going to be that's a big report then.  Yeah, but evaluation. We should probably write some user documentation because I bet that'll get a smart. Yeah. You think? Yeah, they'd love that kind of stuff. You should probably just will just write the little help files or some choir apart or like integrate two tips that would be visible. Yeah. Yeah, I've got a basic search for us.  I've got a user interface. Have you Java doc that? No. I'd also wear is it? I'm still in my directory because the particular directory is code version in the Greek directory is not the right. Yeah, I've not been using that. Yeah, I've just been taking the class files from your directory. Having said that, Dave, you could probably, like, if we want, we could probably go back to the group directory and just use this trick. It really seems to be all about starting in the directory.  But I mean if the two of us that just work one edit that's make difference because I've already mounted your directory now, sir Okay, probably should wait till we have it ready for you guys to use and we'll put it back in the group directory So I'll try and do that today So I've got time today as long as I run into problems and see it taking too long  I've got a sentence length incorporated into my importance measure at the moment too. Well in that case it's pretty, I mean that's probably fine I mean. But if we do it twice it wouldn't make too much sense. Yeah, it would both. I'm not sure how much it should be done in the program because  I don't know. I think it should probably be done offline. What? The basic. Combining all of that. Wave is just multiplying two numbers that can be done in the program because then we can. Because what we could do is have a slide power we can adjust this value. Actually, if you can figure out a way like how basically a general wave because there's at least two points at which we are interested in that, how we can just  have a slide bar which we can read and write which is in a frame of that type that would be good it shouldn't be difficult should it mean to chess we can take over that right one yeah but it might be more difficult let's see you could if you're lucky you probably have to extend that class and then you can work with that value but if you're unlucky it might be quicker to just write a very simple swing component which is just a bar you can just add it to the panel like what I bet not so  Yeah, yeah, yeah, so because we basically would be good to have two different ones to play around with one for controlling the length of the summary and another one for For the merging factor if we do it that way with the geometric Yeah, yeah, it's just a single formula factor  Yeah, um, how is the audio thing going is that you've probably not had time to work on that? Yeah, like last week. I just not got anything But I can't see it taking a long again Okay, it seems that at the moment a lot of the stuff that has to be done is sort of at the moment I was saying I would if can you do this so that's not ideal? To be honest, I did like nothing really on it last week. So I've got time today tomorrow and probably Friday. Okay, so  Because I think I mean the audio is in the end the audio is a very important component of it just because it's it's gonna look stupid if we have everything working but just if it's just annoying because I need to be that one guys for change the content compile under the speech tools and most of the dice machines that have working sound  Is there any way for X forwarding sound? No idea. Because that would be sort of the nice way to sit at home and have it forward the sound at the lowest bit rate to you. I mean seeing that it's over broadband, it's forwarding the graphics quite okay. It would probably like broadband wise, bandwidth wise probably work out.  But it's probably not a simple thing. Well, like what I can do is I'm pretty confident that it'll just be writing a script and it'll just go as long as I can test the script like once. That's working fine. I can just make it return dummy stuff so it works on other machines. Yeah, are you not creating files anywhere like sort of real files? Yes. So that you can do an ad-machine in the pen energy. I know why.  I can change the scripts over I'm using my one at home. I can just add SSH stuff in to the sound tools on the device and then copy that. One problem with SSH in general is that the machine that like the only gateway machines they hate you for doing anything on them. And there's no simple way, I haven't found one to direct  directly in a single step sort of SSH and then SSH again. Actually, I guess if you put SSH and you can give a command of right after word SSH, if that command is SSH again. If you, that would require that you have all your key files set correctly, which I haven't, because it always fucks up on my system. Maybe if you get that working, then you should be able to directly go into another machine.  Yeah  to the from where before so the reason why the summary didn't work well in the last one it works well now is because based on the bottom data the data is so homogenously high in its important rating that it just sort of then everything else being equal took the first ones more or less but now it's working better because now it's not much more evenly distributed I wonder if we should do something like dropping the bottom third then remapping the lowest remaining one  to zero. We're getting much nicer distribution. The most professional way of doing it would be to map them according to the standard deviation because that word would automatically always. It's sort of like it's the problem is it's more calculation expensive and slightly more complicated. But actually in terms of calculation, it's not much. Have you ever like, you know, generally about standard deviation? It's a very simple formula to basically just whatever the average of means squared difference  from the mean or something which the problem with it is that generally you first have to get the mean and only only once you have the mean you know what? In one go. Yeah, I have to arrive at that. I have to arrive at myself like I didn't find it so I did it myself and it took me a day with a formula but then I'm slow at maths. So the good thing about that would be that if you simply say that whatever one standard deviation below the mean is zero and one standard deviation above the mean is one or two standard deviation or something then whatever the data is like it would always normalize  Yeah, that's pretty quite a good idea. Yeah, it's not the symbols, but that's the most professional way I can think about it. That would indirectly also drop stuff. I mean, that would drop whatever is below. So if you find that formula, that would be good. Otherwise, I can see if I can still understand like I did it in my program. It was really stupid. Like the standard standard deviation formula just requires you to have the mean initially. And that makes some things exactly twice as computationally expensive. And there is a way of doing it cumulatively.  So yeah, so that's one possible way of doing that.  We're only going to present this once and we can probably just like sort of start it up before the presentation starts So we shouldn't it all be worried about it's actually quite beautiful It's like if you want a program only to run once and only a part of it You don't worry if it crashes afterwards if it wastes all the resources it format the hardest can be and anyway, I'm rambling. Yeah, no it does not it does not if it a change to that just  that means that you would start at 15 times over in a 15-some beats running. Does anyone know anything about which dice machines have sound cards and how to find them? Because the thing is, we can, like this at the moment, we're is working because it has a sound card. The interesting thing is that because of the structure of this, it isn't enough to just say, well, if you don't have a sound card, you don't have sound, at least I think that's what I remember. I probably watched that.  So I've worked around that there is ways I think to get around it but the problem is So you basically have to we have to have two code versions and one for sound card and one for non sound card machines to test it on Because you have to change all sorts of other things if you don't have a sound card So there isn't a simple way to just tell which one's sound card machines aren't just to use sound card machines. Yeah, that makes it really quite difficult for us if you want to  I'm so excited to fight for a computer. But I guess I mean, if you trust in Dave's summary for the audio, just putting all these things into sound, then having your grip in summary. Yeah, I just care for the rhythm and just work without a sound. Yeah, so the thing, they really easy it's way, if you just make a sound card and a non sound card version of it. Because I don't think we should bother to move on it on the sound card version. Yeah, but then that means that the girls can't test it. That's the problem.  and all that happens is it refuses to load the clock. You still get the display in there. Yes, but without the clock you don't have. Well actually you're right, it doesn't strictly have to do any movement. So you can still click on the segment and that will still work like that. Yeah, but we have to comment stuff out for that. I think at the moment, if you click on a segment it automatically sets the whole clock thing going out of stuff. So we have to comment out stuff. So that's what I'm saying that there is we could make it a flag, couldn't we? We could just make the  like a runtime flag and then make a few ifs and say if. And it must be a way of detecting whether the clock's loaded like. Yes, there is. There is. There is try and set something on the clock and use try and catch. And then if you catch the exception, set the flag. Yeah. So anyway, so that's something we should probably do in one way or another because it seems to us that the overwhelming majority of those machines don't have sound cards.  Okay, we want to have a look at the agreement and disagreement data that I worked on last week. Or do you have anything more? There's nothing much to talk about this. So apart from like a search box and the similarity thing, once that kicks off, which is gonna be horrible, but this is more or less in the end. Like this is very similar to what our product will look like in the end. Seeing that really  with a given time frame we're not going to do amazing new things from now on. So I'll be hopeful. Perhaps my list of agreements. Yeah. If we find them good enough. I wanted to provide that an extra list.  display to annotate them in this way. Yeah, we could just make click on the point in time and display it. Not just yet, but that should that's actually that's probably the only thing I can say I can do this week because that should be I mean, I'll do it in an inefficient way. I'll effectively sort of go through all the segments and check if they actually come but I think they thought we should do is that that time click of the clock. I think that's changeable. And I think we should probably increase that because of the moment it's 0.1 seconds.  And that's just there is actually there's some background noise when it's working and I think that it's because it's like doing so much every time Yeah, it's probably because you I'm not sure if you have the version with a display it whether this place actually updating up here when it's moving on So I mean yes, it is because my display is programmed in efficiently But I think with it to give them time constraints is probably easy instead of making a very efficient display code to just make the time make the clock whatever 0.5 seconds something  Do you want to monitor as long as you can skip More accurately than the time step that's fine. Otherwise you might risk cutting bits off If I can skip more accurately then like if you want to jump to a point you need to be able to jump more accurately in half second by half second you miss words  Are we still with that idea that we want to display bars for the individual speakers? Yeah, okay. And I'm speaking more, but I don't know why that is. Oh yeah, I can probably because it's coming from my resolution and it's you have a much higher resolution. Yeah, perhaps because it's white screen or something.  Okay, what you see here in this part is... No, no, no, yeah, there it is, yeah. Here is a list of the most important or most probable words that are cure in agreement. So the number in the first brackets is... So I run it on all the beads  DBMR and PRO meetings to learn it. So the number in the first brackets is how often it occurred in the addresses that were annotated as agreements by the dialogue act agreement. And the number in the second brackets is how much it occurred in the rest. And the first number in every line is how much more often  That is per same text length. So the words that it gives are look quite good, I think it's exciting, perfect, true, interesting, exactly correct, super and so on. And then I ran it on the first meeting, getting the, so what's in the, in the brain,  And the second one is the second one.  So that should, in principle, favor longer utterances. And so these numbers here, one or zero this year. And that's the dialogue act labels whether it's, if they're annotated as agreement, they're not zero here.  here for those who get to that get a very high score, they're mostly not zero. And some of those who are zero are still very good. Like I definitely agree, isn't this kind of agreement that we probably want to have? And when you get further down, you see those with very low score also have  No agreements. Again, I think that's probably a good part if we had a slide bar initially where we could dynamically adapt the threshold of what we just buy. Yes, so maybe it's just like maybe it's just good to have like some generic component with three slide bars or something where we can relatively easily add a fourth one or something, you know, and just like sort of all our fiddle factors. Because we will hide that in the presentation.  In some cases we could put it as a feature and say, you know, you can dynamically... Like we don't want, I don't think we want to have exposed the user doing things like adding the threshold of which. We wouldn't call it threshold, do you want sort of like the granularity of decision, something like it. So... Decision, fun, colour. And everything above that threshold, I could then, at the utterance where it occurs, just put a certain graphic light in like a handshake or something cool.  Right, so it looks quite good I think so that's what I got for a agreement then for disagreement I did also but it's a bit more difficult because they're so little disagreement Yeah, so they use again see the list, but it's much shorter and it's much Yes, I was saying like it's so temptable smiley smiley and yellow angry faces  Beautiful and that is here the list of entrances it gets us for the first meeting Didn't somebody say that actually like a lot of agreements have have actual words which are such a disagreement like yeah, I mean I think perhaps that's why we have that right it's so high here Yeah, yeah, so you can you I think I think yeah, yeah, I think so right  the  Yeah, I can just give it to you in the format you want. So I would just... And then the score, yeah, this was just for showing it. If they're corresponding for each thing, yeah, they should be right. So for each utterance, you have one disagreement. Yeah. So I'll read that into...  the  to code a lot more readable for everybody's playing around with it. You know what I mean? So just like whatever three means agreement value and then I just write something agreement and then it's easier to understand for both of us what's going on. One problem I still have is both over years because I mean obviously they're all right at the same so I was thinking perhaps at looking at the acoustic  I have so for example at my F0 deviation but yeah, by now I just had to look at the year data and actually the average F0 deviation is only slightly higher for the positive ones than for the negative ones. I mean there is a difference but that's probably not significant enough to really make  But I would also investigate some... But... I would also... Yeah, is occurring not only as an agreement but really frequently as like an encouragement as well. Yeah, so my hypothesis was that if it's really... Yeah, I like agreement, it will sound different. And if it is just a lecture. But you know what, I think we should put the threshold for that one in the end quite high anyway. It probably doesn't matter.  much of a difference because I think this thing. But that has nothing to do with a threshold. Because you have you don't have it on you with yes you have it also with words that are much higher ranked. You have the same problem like for example with yep as much higher ranked because it's often in the training thing. But I mean the fact that different ones have the same number in itself is in the problem is it?  No, it's only if they're used in different contexts. So if for every app you'd be sure that it's an agreement and that wouldn't be a problem. So you're saying that you're not sure if every app is an agreement or? Yes, I know that not every app is an agreement because this right the app and okay things are typically also a picture. What's the highest ranked one that kind of  Yeah, but we would throw a lot away that quite good If you would set it so over over how many different over which length is this now? This is like  So the third column is the a transfer rate occurs right? Yes. Okay, so I think we really do have to put the threshold quite quite high then because otherwise you'd get icons alive. Yes, because I was just checking you know like how far apart are they and at the moment that's definitely not a good thing to display if they're like an average 10 10 utterances apart or something. Yeah, so we won't probably want to take a threshold at least 50 or 60 just  looking at that. I think for this meeting there were... Was it around 90 annotated agreements or yeah, agreement dialogue acts? See we probably just played 90. We don't want to rate them. It was how important they were wouldn't be.  I mean, the best ones are definitely those on the first screen here. So again, I'd say probably a good way of going about that question is to have control, which we can vary in the distance. And then just sort of, because that's in the end how it's going to be evaluated. You know, in the end, this is kind of like, I mean, we're going to present it and say, yeah, so this is our, it shows this agreement. And then we see what looks good and what looks, I think for we looks credible, like in every sort of every topic segment has  We are like something in between three and five agreements but not more probably maybe less but not much less and actually I think that doesn't have to be one in everything. Yeah, probably I have to put them because some of them are also I mean this is just added by different speakers for example there immediately following one another but it's just two speakers agreeing I think same for this one here.  So you're still here? We probably want to merge ones very close. I mean, that will be up to be merged anyway. Yes, but maybe an expensive, or maybe an astute looking way though. We should probably make some logic when it displays it. If that one's very close together. Yeah, I would just think they can probably be done on display level.  That's just nice looking quite good though. It's one crash man. Just crashed I think it's just bad. It probably just kept on playing and now reached some Whatever I think it's always really funny that when you look at people's computers, you don't use a computer much their desk. That's really tidy. I only keep the stuff I actually need on it and then I can't ever you know  But actually this is a here is an SSD because it was data I that didn't fit on my quote anymore So do we want to have keywords for each topic segment or something? Yeah I think sort of the bottom line in which might well end up  What it's going to be like is that we take the single higher strength utterance and put that as a title like realistically looking at this from the time we have left to do this and stuff Because what I do is having values for each segment at the moment So I could just extract the highest ones for each segment. I don't know if that's good but At least I could provide some value. Yeah  Yeah, maybe one was on a single, like, is that on a word basis? Would that be single words? So would that be? It doesn't matter to me. Because check out what they would be like on a word basis. Maybe actually if there's one word, which is very typical, I mean, it's probably somewhere like, because that's like the only time that air was spelled with three A and stuff. I think that actually that might be a problem of the whole meditation that if they aren't exactly consistent in how they describe stuff like that, they're really good.  Yeah, that's why we were thinking sometimes like why is mmm Hi, but then probably it's the only time that mmm were spelled with a dotted D and stuff so but yeah, like if if single we should Download a dictionary and check our entrances before we Some to make sure that they're actually real words. I can see why I have dictionaries if it's just like I have Abitra really long lists from the British National Corpus of when you  Do not include, well, at least it is consistently enough that I think you can filter them out fairly well. Yeah, I mean, see how it turns out. If I look good, then that's a good way of doing it as any of those ways. Yeah, so if, like, I mean, if the single best one word for a second is interesting, that would be really good.  It seems to be how you should do is take the highest three or four and then just merge them together into one of the strengths. It gives a random sense but it gives a full theory of what they're actually talking about. Can we go backwards here now suddenly crash? Yeah. Yeah, I mean that was sort of in the original quantum then the nice fancy drawing  that we gave Stephen them and that was part of it that sort of within a segment you had these sub-segments that each of them had different words and whatever have our dreams. Yeah, other assignments. No, I don't think we have. Which is a shame. Is it living cool? Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna have time to make it display like a whole archive of meetings. Or is it just gonna be displaying single meetings in New Orleans at the moment? It doesn't really care how many meetings is this late?  Puma and solution is probably going to be to have a list draw a big black line on the board as I think oh such you're think floating them all at once well You can if you want to yeah, yeah, it can display from any entrance to any other entrance. It doesn't really Yeah, the dialogue I use this star zero-fleach meeting we don't run continuously  Yeah, I think that like the drawing has to be changed anyway. That's not the idea at the moment.  the general works fine. For the display it should make much different because I think everything in the display code is just from the first and to the last one display it. So if the other performance is okay then we should really just load the whole thing in. And very interesting we will have to do is we want we'd really want a different behaviour if we clicked on the whole meeting in a segment. So if there's more than one meeting displayed it should  If you click even on one of the segments of that meeting, I think it should re-enash rise and display that just that meeting. I'm not sure how easy that would be to do. I see that probably just means that the display sort of has an internal knowledge about what level of zoom it has. So initially the display, it just needs to know whether it's displaying more than one whole meeting, doesn't it? That's the only knowledge it would need.  Yes. Yeah. That's probably fairly simple to actually. If we do it in that most primitive way of just saying as long as it's play more than one meeting, that gets sufficient to claim that we'd implement it some kind of zoom as well. Yeah. We then need some way of getting back up again in the hierarchy, but then in the worst cases, which is just be a static sort of error  button in the right hand, top corner of the display and you press that and then you're on the display the whole thing again. But for that at the moment my display code needs that thing to work the one. I know that's working at the moment anyway the one that I just say give me 100 values over that length and then you're internally. Okay, but that's okay as long as my display I was just thinking my display can't handle displaying a million different segments but nobody doesn't have to.  Now it doesn't have to. Okay, well that's all details. Dave, can you just turn this what we have right now? I actually do a code for ease on it. Do you want me to put a search in? I'll probably tonight just work on getting a frozen version that was consistently. Make a document for me. That's probably enough for me to add it in. Unless you want to.  I've not documented the program manager class. It's a bit hairy. Anyone feels they have free time. That's such a joke. One thing that would be convenient for all sorts of things in which I haven't found out about it is how to do tooltips in an arbitrary way in swing graphic displays. Now there are simple ways of doing tooltips over a given element. Like if you have a button, you just give it a tooltip text. But there is means of doing tooltips  that I put my mouse over, that's how I put my mouse over this line here and then it would tell me something about what it is. And I would be quite convenient for a lot of things because then we can sort of have a lot of information in the display, in the way that just went the mouse is over it. But I haven't figured out how it works and that's something that probably, so if everyone is ever bored or if anyone feels that they can do that. Okay, so probably what you'd want to do is detect where the mouse is and change the default tool for that.  component. Yes, but it automatically displays the position when you hover. Yeah, but the thing is it isn't simply an act of setting a string default tooltip. There seems to be something about a tooltip object that you have to create and give it all sorts of different properties and stuff. You might not really want to be creating a new one every time you move them out. So anyway, I haven't looked much into that. So if anybody looks into that, then let me know. Otherwise, I'll start looking into it as soon as I have time again. But if any  I found some stuff about it on the web and it just looked to me like proper coding like I saw half page code samples which effectively just displayed a tooltip and I didn't have the time at that point to get deeper into that so if anybody gets any good samples of that Anyways that I said it for now is the old is that version all in  No, but I'm going I'm going up Apple Tower now and I have my external heart discs I can So I'll start working on that in like half an hour or something and it will be Yeah, okay Is there any die machines in this building? Really accessible for me can you show me where because I'm actually not going to happen tower at the moment So I don't have to go up and down I She know what I have to go there anywhere and put a piece of paper on two machines where some stuff of mine is running on  Yeah, and I think like I'll just I'll just kick in full time for analysis D next week because there's nothing I have to do then Apart from cognitive modeling which I think I'll just do in five hours three hours If you take me look at that Yeah, but not too detailed so I might just not go for the last question because usually the last question is what takes half the time and gives you five percent  Okay, yes, we're gonna talk about the evaluation next week We really need to get in contact with the other group and see if they want to join evaluation Thanks on the analysis and ski work  I was sort of in this mindset like I first knew there's a lot of time between the presentation and the report and then I knew oh now the presentation is shifted that the correlation between those two facts into dependencies there's some fancy plan  language about that. But that is the frame problem. Yes, it is probably some version of the frame problem. Frame problem hasn't been clear to me. I think it is going to get a not bad at the moment actually. By the way, how long, how much time do we have for the presentation?  Yeah, but more like 20 minutes or more like an hour. Well, I reckon that it's a kind of a normal person. I reckon that if you present the components or what it's based on then you will need more than 20 minutes to present it. Yes. But if you just present the functionality of the thing, if you're not, I don't think this presentation is about the internal working. So for a demo, I think realistically since everything in this university sort of works in work,  So it's two groups and it probably is going to be roughly half an hour. Yeah, and like 10 minutes without before we set up time as well. 10 minutes now before we set up time as well. Now why is this is going to be so bad like there's got to be some smaller maybe you should present it on your laptop because we can be really sure it's running. Yeah, but the performance is really bad at the moment of that one though. Plus we would have to get the speech tools running on my laptop.  I can get my computer and look at that sound to give me a lift and a lot of a couple people to cause. Yeah, maybe let's see. It could just be flooned on the laptop for all I know. I mean, like at the moment it's not too bad apart from I think the sound is stuttering and that's I think because of that laptop. But we can only really judge that once we have sound. I'll just need to bring the box. I'm pretty sure I think Nick left off someone. How fast does he always wear?  I think it doesn't have to run on anything.  idea to run the speech tools in the sequence. No, but the sequence should run the Java as well. Wherever this is going, it doesn't sound good. He can use my laptop as a server. It's a sound server, but that would still mean that we have to get the speech tool running on this.  The way Java works is that I think it'll run on their Dias machine if we're doing it. If we we should definitely test it the day before. Yeah, test it before we go. So Dave, are you going to make something primitive that people can load that 18? Yeah. Oh, yeah.  I don't send around Nemo when it's gone. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not 100% sure what needs to be changed to make it work with a... To make it not crash if it doesn't have a sound card. There's quite a bit you have to comment out for that. Just do because...  methods which probably expect some so I think if the display itself isn't doing anything clalky so as long as in the main in the program manager everything clalky is is removed but it might be worthwhile to check how much more work it would be to do it over a flag because then in the end because otherwise we always have two code words and people might be changing the wrong one really we shouldn't even need a flag you should be able to do it with exceptions I mean that's this kind of a  Yeah, I know that like if you don't do it with the exception to get crashes that's what figured out like if you don't have a sound cut it crashes even if you don't use sound Yeah, okay cool  I think the display has some method for it. I'm reluctant for the program manager then to call it. 100% sure what it's called but the display has some method where you tell it where to start in the trend.  playing lists of matches.  I was wrong I was thinking it's exactly the same thing that happens when we say set select and it's not actually a set selection does everything you want sort of Yeah, it says if you look at that there was a selection doesn't update the display though because Well, it doesn't tell the display which parts would do which part to to display because the display has just called set selection Yeah, it doesn't matter because if it's jumped to in the East hex area  You'll display the line or jump when they're there. Yeah, but that only works that at the moment isn't done throughout system That's just done because then the time changes It's actually a time change but automatically put the position of the display in the right hand play No, but that's not a good idea because that could well be outside the displayed area then And also the real time and play time stuff will change. Yeah, so so yeah, we need to read initialize  Yeah, and I think the display has a method for that ready, which is called, anyway, the display is something useful for that, something which probably starts with the word set. Yeah, you can set the Windows start utterance and Windows end utterance. Okay. But yeah, we need to do something to ensure that the search result is in  Yeah, that's crazy. So we probably want a different summary constructor that takes an additional argument of an ID and that reference will always be in the summary. Alternatively, there's always the method of just giving it to really high score. As a hack, you know, it actually, as long as you then don't, well, probably people wouldn't know it, as still doesn't guarantee that we're here because if you get a number of  of them.  and otherwise it would be too complicated to cope with the system if you have to readjust it to a different zoom level to get better results Probably, but we have strange the end the eyes of the user We need to make a summary that's the same length Yeah, that's the selection and I would ensure that the search term came up alright Yeah, I think proportion like even though I'm always getting myself confused about this  I think sort of making the summary link thing generally proportion, like as a as a proportional factor of its original length, there's a good way of going about it because anything with absolute length sort of stupid because that means that a long long segment gets to 1% of its length and another one gets to exactly the same length stuff. So if you're doing it by a proportion, then just having 1.0 or something makes it very easy to always end up at actually that's what I've currently like the current code just takes a tenth of the summary length that will have  Yeah, and that's the type of slider that we can actually leave in and like show yeah, that's functionality. Yeah, that's sort of like your level of zoom of impending doom Should we quit here anything to be discussed? Because I'm gonna copy  Otherwise, you'll definitely see my name at the end. So I'll just.  I  So it didn't look to be like, it wasn't doing an overly thorough instruction to me because I was just 10 minutes where I picked this, how you started it.  I think I've had a few people have done courses that do a little bit of stuff. So, the best thing about the UTMAP is this. I can't out of a more than a really half an afternoon to see I know.  Can you just remind me I don't have to tick the note and okay thing until I finish writing but it's only like go back to it I tick okay again  So if I'm working, if I've done a page, I'm on the second page. I tick it, say I'm, I finish that page and I go back to it. So I can just write and then not tick until I finish writing again. Yeah. So it's always after and you never have to do it before. Fine. Fine.  I don't believe all this stuff is just amazing. And you can go on both sides as well. OK. Yeah, right. Why should we start? Well, I think the first thing is... Well, the first thing I think is we need to sort out the call fountains, sort of the call for titles because something that's kind of...  over due. Right. Yeah. So I volunteered to do that if you like. Okay, so I'll do that by I think was it Thursday today. I'll do that by the end of the week anyway.  You're going to, was it your idea to stick a bit in it where you say, you know, we're inviting like from quite a wide audience when we gave priority to linguists? Yeah, we're going to do that, but I think we should probably send out separate calls. Okay, so we'll send one that we're in inviting other people, but I think it will probably just, I mean, it probably won't matter too much to the other linguists that we're having other people there. We can mention it, but  It's not going to be too essential and we might actually just end up making them worry that you know They're gonna lose their place or whatever. Yeah separate causes good idea, but we do we do have to decide a priority thing so that's something else we can look at a little bit Later down the line so so that's the one for Ling basically and I'll send that out  I'll do that today or tomorrow. Now, Claire, that's the other thing. She can deal with the psychology. Psychology people probably that's, I reckon that's the best thing to do. Because she'll know which email address to use and everything else. So, if one of us  of a skid email Claire. Is it was that a volunteering? Yeah. Yeah. Or when it goes. So, if Robert emails Claire, and we're going to need to decide exactly what she's going to say on there, we might need to just remind her of the dates because she doesn't know. Yeah. She gets the dates, right?  And she I know she already knows that it's just anyone doing cycling with sticks, but basically So that's fine. And that's you kind of take care of itself as well. If she just ends one round to everyone then only the cycling list will say was for me. Yeah, exactly But then there's a rest of people else and I think we need to decide whether  The text for the actual call, is she going to rework something or... I think she should just, I think she should just write her own probably. I think she might be glad to see their wonderful linguistics. Okay, so what we'll do is always question. I mean, the thing is that the main call will go out before she's got round to anyway. So what I'll do is I'll cop it. I'll see see her on the...  Because I can't imagine there'd be an essential difference, really, between it. No, there won't be. I just, the only thing I'm thinking is I want to make sure that it stands out as something applicable to them, that they don't go, or we're just getting rubbish from, you know what I mean. Yeah. I want them to really know that it's a dress to them. And the good thing about Claire sending it is she's probably got a psych email address as well and it might look a bit more relevant to them.  They know her. Yeah, exactly. They know her, etc. So, yeah, so if we've, if I've received the original one, then you can tell her that that can be the basis for the basis for her email, but just make sure that they know it's relevant to them, etc. And obviously in PPLS, we've also got English language now.  In a way we could send out that first call to them, just as part of the same email, because I think they're more likely to think it was relevant to them. I don't really know what you think about that, but I think we definitely should open it up to English language. I think particularly at the moment, because they're really trying to sort of get mergers into one subject area, even though it should be meaningless, because we're all part of the school, I think that it does actually make a difference.  So I think we should invite them, but then we've still got the problem of priority issue. So probably what I was thinking is certainly second and third years absolutely need to be top priority. But then there's a kind of awkward question of where we put first years because they don't need to if they want to, should they have priority.  of lower point but it kind of crosses over with deciding what we're going to do when we... Well do we have an idea of how many people are going to actually have their whole thing? Because then it seems to me to be quite obvious that we just had to interact with a number of second-thirds students and everything else is just I would favour doing it just on a first-come first-third basis.  Okay. I'll have to send out the console as possible. See what reactions we get and then, okay. But I mean, like, see, we're going to do this thing for, um, I can't even remember. Was it two or three days? It's three days. Okay. And so how many, how many posters and talks? Why are you going to actually go in there? They were 20, 20 minute talks were 10 minute, uh, question time. Okay. And  You can run two in a row, but probably three to three. Two in a row or three in a row. Could you turn a row in that's narrow and then give it a 20 minute break perhaps. Yeah, I mean the thing is every time we have a break there's a question of whether we should be served coffee and biscuits and things because that's the kind of thing to do.  I'm thinking, a lot of, what on a half hour each? So three, actually, each that will be three per day, times three will be 27. So are you saying have say three sessions in a row and then do that twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon? So it'd be six in the morning, twice in the afternoon. Oh, so just have an hour and a half in the morning. Yeah. I mean, or twice in the morning, once in the afternoon.  I mean would six hours a day be pushing it? Not necessarily because I mean the good thing is we'll do get that many people wanting to give talks. Well I suppose what we can do is think about the structure now and say right what's the maximum we can do? So I think that's about as much as we could do to have an hour and a half then have a coffee break then have an hour and a half then have lunch hour and a half coffee break hour and a half and so that would be 18 hours of talk  over all the net. But what do we say? So it's 12, 36 talks. Is that right? Maximum of 36. How many seconds  I'm a third year. Students are there. Well, I could look as I've got that. There's the list, there's no postgraduate, so I maintain in linguistics. There are probably about 30 on there. Right, okay. But a good number of them are first years, and I don't know.  I mean, just to get an idea, are you planning on talking? No, are you planning? Well, no, and I'm probably not. So there's a good chance that almost none of the first years are gonna volunteer. So if we had say 20 linguistics and even then, I mean, there were quite a few people who were abroad and who won't bother to turn up or can't make it or whatever. So, you know, it might be that we only get say 15 anyway.  we could be left with 15 blocks for the rest of PPLS. So at least we know that we've got an absolute limit of about 36 talks.  We're also going to be having posters, aren't we? And I should imagine that most people would rather do a poster than get those hurt. And that's what the coffee breaks will be for, and maybe lunch times. But coffee breaks are probably more like a better time because people were hanging around, whereas people were more likely to go off somewhere for lunch, aren't they? Yeah, but wouldn't we want to actually just dedicate an afternoon or a moment  to be a post-decession. That's what I was about to say post-decession is a good idea because just the people presenting the posters are there and can say something about it. Actually there's always a problem again then the people who are presenting the posters still get around to go and look at others. But people kind of like generally sort of sort them up and sort that out themselves. I mean it's the thing about posters unless you kind  of say, you know, if your name is in the first half of that, you can move and everyone's can't. So how long should a poster session be? How long will people want to mill around for looking at? I'd make it a whole morning or a whole afternoon. I mean, just because like ones that I've been to as well, people tend to kind of come and go from them. And I'd say a whole  I'm just based on the ones that I've been to. So that means we could have 30 talks plus 1 a.m. or p.m. of posters. And we could probably get quite a few in there. At least six. At least six. At least six.  posters.  I've ever been to the posters of all was being in the coffee break, which is why. Probably because normally they're limited on space. Actually, we have a message here from Mitzvah about the poster session. Yeah. The poster session was introduced in 1999 as part of the main conference. In 2000, it was held separately in October. The intention was to use it as a way to introduce incoming post-grad students to the department's research culture. However, I did not pursue this idea the following year because the comments I received from students in 2000 were generally discouraged.  On the other hand, I later learned that some students did find the October poster session quite a useful experience. My suggestion, therefore, is to re-examine the idea of poster session altogether and find a better way to implement it if there seems to be enough interest in it. Well, I think keeping it alongside the conference is possibly one way of my opinion. Yeah, my last sentence. One possibility is to put it back in the main conference and let people choose between a paper presentation and a poster.  Yeah, I think that's definitely the idea. I can imagine it would seem a bit random just to have a post-assession and just to have a post-assession. What would it be at the beginning? So I suppose is it normally second years do it just after they've come back for this?  It's goal was to give the new intake. Yeah, but I don't think he means that it would be That first is who have only just arrived would do a post. I don't know. Yeah Okay, so at least anyone who's doing do yeah exactly. Yeah, I might do I still a little bit doubtful that That's good anyway, so We've got  And I think there's 30 talks and say, 6, 10 posters, whatever, we can manage to fit in the room. So we need to look at where we're going to hold it. We could have it in B9, but there's things all over the wall. There are those pictures that run all the way around. Can we take the pictures down? Can we use B9 for the posters? Well, should I have, generally, these poster boards, if there are some poster boards that we can get hold on,  Okay, so post the boards. I'll do all the email mitts about that. Okay. Right into the call that we are considering the idea of having a poster session. So people can indicate would they prefer to give a poster or a talk? Yeah, okay. But the ultimate decision is on our set because we have to see how does work out  or the poster session. What we'll do is say, if you want to do a talk, then just say so. And if you want to do a poster and say you want to do a poster and we can sort of base it around that. And if we get absolutely tons of people wanting to do posters and we don't think there's, you know, everyone's kind of done as a cop out, then we might have to sort of say to them, well, you know, would you consider doing a toy instead because, particularly the second and third years,  we need more talks and just do it like that. We could even say something like, first is might want to give a post or something like that because I don't know, maybe that's a bad idea. Just put it on a general suggestion at them. See what happens.  Okay, so we got some sort of idea of the structure and How many talks are we going to be able to have? Well, I mean like that will evolve when we get a response from Yeah, people. Okay, that's fine. So I Okay, so English language We'll put on the main call and I'll just I'll just kind of market it  as the linguistics in English language or something like that I think. And is it the other main group then philosophy? Yes and informatics. So I had a look at whether they do philosophy of language and logic and stuff here and they kind of do. There's about three or four  full-time members of staff that list philosophy of language as a major interest. So chances are they're going to have some PhD students that are interested. So do we think we should invite them? I think I'd be surprised if we got sort of four out of them. I think that would be still amazing if we did. So I think it's probably worth it. I don't think we're going to get inundated with requests. So I think it's worth asking them.  I'm asking for philosophy. Yeah. And thinking informatics. Word. I mean, I think informatics are definitely worth asking. There's the CSTR and HCRC. I mean, I'm thinking that the informatics potentially is quite a big response. Yes. It is. Yeah. It might be interesting stuff coming in.  Which is something recently about I think somebody's master's project to Look in how far English is actually or in how far English is a shaping influence on programming languages. All right, cool Yeah, it is Would we want to ask them and put some kind of like proviso in to make it?  specific to preemptively, we doubt the numbers of should we just say to you. How do we do that language? It would be nice to think about. The thing is we can't afford to bias it towards any particular kind of linguistics in a sense because it's such a, because of the way our department is, then we're supposed to sort of embrace all kinds. In fact, even by inviting people from  informatics and from, well maybe from philosophy and things, it might bias it in a particular direction, but I don't know, it's probably not too bad. I think that between philosophy and informatics and psychology you've probably got quite a lot of bread there anyway. The thing is, the only kind of people doing anything like applied linguistics, are they applied linguists themselves and people in social  I don't think that's too bad because the first thing is there's a good reason for inviting everyone in PPLS because we are in one school and then the fact that we also invite people from informatics I suppose it's just that we do have pretty strong ties with them I don't think anyone would be too offended So yeah, so we're going to be a little bit more  what kind of provides that can we put on? I mean, we could just say outright anyone in their third year or anyone in their second or third year. But I don't know. Or we can just take whatever we get and pick the best between us, which is, yeah. So you're most straightforward. Yeah, just say the general thing, say the linguistics department's having this conference and what do we do in the fight?  So who wants to send something out to informatics? Oh, yeah, that's fine. All right, and if I get into actually philosophy as well. Yeah, sure. So, yeah, so what you want to say is anyone who wants to give a talk on logic or philosophy of language  But put a warning that if it's logic then there's a good chance that no one will understand or not that many I mean maybe just maybe if you just put Yeah, just put philosophy of language That's that's probably good. Yeah. I mean, I just already send them a thing same thing. We're a part of the class is having a postgraduate thing so if you're a philosophy student with You know your work has got an interest in language. Yeah  That's what you do. That's what you do. That's what you do. That's what you do. That's what you need to say. That's right. So you've got to work out basically thinking who's just sending them your call for papers and changing it slightly to say, yeah, philosophy students. That's fine. That's fine. That's what you want to do. As long as it's clear from the subject, bar that it's relevant to them and that it says somewhere that for philosophy students with an interesting language and  And then between us we'll have to have another meeting and I mean at the same time as we're sorting through all the other titles and deciding how to divide up the sessions. Someone suggested to me that it's actually better to have talks on a similar topic spread out as much as possible which to me just seemed absolutely crazy and the reason she gave me was something to do with taking out like an  whole day or a whole afternoon would be quite difficult. But I think that balance against the fact that most people want to be able to say, well, look, I can have just this one day off as opposed to what I need an hour over three days. You know, an hour or a year, you say for three days, you could end up having to take three afternoons or three mornings or whatever off. So I think in general, and also for the sake of the lecturers, I think a lot of the time Simon Kirby has already said to me that any of his students he wants to be on the first day on the Wednesday, right?  And that's because I shifted it. I basically had it on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday to begin with. And then it moved down twice to Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. So Wednesday is the only day left that he can make. Oh, I see right. He wants to do that because he can make it. Yeah. So, and the other thing is when we get some calls, say we have, for instance, three people supervised by Bob Black, then it might be that then we are going to have to contact Bob and say,  They're going to be talking. Presumably you want to be there. So can you give us a time that would be good for you? And then we can put them in a block at once. Because he says, yeah, OK, Thursday afternoon, I've got completely free. And so I think we do need to stick everyone together. Particularly if they've got the same supervisor. And it's also good if talks are on the same topic for a whole morning or a whole afternoon, because then people will come along and go, oh, this morning, it's all on phonology or this morning, it's all on a blinding wistics.  Okay. As much as possible anyway. And that's so far as just a general statement of interest, what we intend to do, what we actually get to do with the later when we have this stuff. Yeah. Now, if I'm going to send that, it's cool. We need a deadline for titles. So.  What should we say something like because we need a deadline for titles and a deadline for abstract. So let's set the latest deadline. The sort of abstract deadline first because we need to have a meeting and that's going to be when all the real work starts. So what's the absolute latest? I mean maybe the end of two weeks ahead and of large.  End of March might be okay. I'm going away for two weeks on the fourth of April and then I'm coming back just in time for the conference so any organizing at least stuff where I need to be we need to meet physically has to be done before that yeah, and that will be a way Probably until Easter so this actually means we have the week directly after Easter between Mike coming back and you leave  I'm leaving. I see you one thing. It's starting on the Wednesday and the first day back is Tuesday. I think I'm coming back. I'm trying to get this right. Hopefully I'll be back in time that we'll be able to do something the day before because I think I'm going to be back. Might even have to come in the evening but that's not the end of the world but we might have to set some things up like maybe just get the chairs organised or whatever.  actually have to go into the rooms and get things ready. And there's going to be other things like getting the technology ready. So not only is there a pressure to have talks that are on a similar topic together, but also if people need the same kind of computer setup, it's good to have them together so we don't have to keep changing it. So because I think it was Cedric has already offered to do whatever we need him to do.  do but you just need to know in advance what people need so that he can be there and get it ready for them. So I think when I think people are actually going to need well hopefully most people would either have something like PowerPoint or they'll just have a PDF slides or something hopefully no one will have anything too specialized. In my experience of what you usually should have is some kind of  What's it overhead yeah, think of Beamer in some cases we might if it's really tough we might be in need of a Some sound system. I mean if it it hasn't been nine got all of that. Yeah, it's got a lot in there. I think it does take a little bit of I mean I think sometimes maybe people need to be in lean X rather than windows and so booting in yeah Yeah, it's sometimes an issue  do I think. But I think what we should say is when I put out this call, I'll put both deadlines and I think I'll say that when you send in your abstract, you need to mention any technology you intend to use. So at least if we have all the information. Yeah, yeah. So deadlines. Okay, so let's think about this. If we gave them a whole month or just over a month, then  That would be okay, wouldn't it? Because we've still got... I don't know, it wouldn't be okay at all. If we gave them the whole month, that would give us hardening time. So if we gave them say, till mid-March, that would be good. So give them something like 10 days or whatever to get the title in, and then give them a week on top of that to get the actual abstract done.  doesn't have to be much. It's probably only half a side of a force, something isn't it? Just enough that we can see whether it's interesting or what kind of area it fits into. That's all we really need. See, ideally I would like to have given them a bit longer, but I think that'll be an ugly animal. So unfortunately I don't have a calendar.  You're gonna send that band crazy That's true. No, it's I think it's okay when you're not working on that So 38 this  So if we have it like a Monday, Monday the 14th would probably be quite good for the final deadline and then if I send it out tomorrow, I would say something like the fourth would be good.  Yeah a week for the title and then they would have about 10 days from then to actually get the abstract in Does that sound reasonable? Why not just give them a week to the abstract? I mean, I'm just thinking about Just put it here. Yeah, the 11th a bit earlier. So I'm saying I don't know I'm saying just give them a bit longer to get back with the title so get back with the title by the seventh or do we need that would be a week anyway? But you can give them 10  to you can give them 10 days to get the title. It depends which way around you want to do it. So what's going to take them longer actually to decide what they're going to do and send the title or is it going to be on the basis of the title? Do they want more time to write the abstract? I think if they're really serious to be a bit late with the title might not be bad because it will help them to so give them the seventh. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So  So Monday the seventh is the title and this presumably will apply across the board. Yeah And Monday the 14th for the abstract move that we've got an email address from Decental is too or was it well we we kind of have I we were given The only thing is accessing the account they can send it to PGC  I'll go and see Mike today and get the password and everything because we possibly have it but I'll just sort that out with him because if we're gonna tell everyone to email PGC then we have to make pretty sure that we can actually access the account and then it's operational and stuff because so far I've just been using my own email address but it would be better it's quite easy to send from an email address  you can send from any email address you like. It's just the fact that when they reply to it you need to be able to access it. So I already tried it once and I'm sure they gave us a password and I even actually...  If you want to send this call for abstracts, you know, when you do the philosophy and thingy one, then if you want to send from PGC, then you might already know, but you can go, if you did it from Webmail, you can just create a new account for yourself, and where it actually has a send from address, and you can just put PGC out of the link and just do it that way, or depending on your normal email client, you might be able to do it, but it doesn't matter too much. The other thing you could do is just fill  in the reply to addresses PGC depending on what you want to do. But that's what I'll do. I'll send it from PGC. So if anyone replies it will just go to that account and any of us can access it at any time. Presumably you can access this up from Webmail or I map or whatever. Should I take care of the web page? Yeah, if you want to create a web page and just copy my email into it or something and anything else you might want to do.  later on we can put the programming.  Why?  We'll just send that on email. Okay. Yeah, another. That would be cool. Okay. So, I mean, I won't get in touch with Floss or our own sending to Floss for any of my text till I've got your email. Yeah, I'll just send that. I have a modified version of that. But I'll try and get a good address to send it to. All right. So that was a note. Okay. I think latest sort of support.  call is out. Yeah, because then we have the call thing. We have that way and we'll get the board organisitorious stuff like that. Do we know about chairs, tea and stuff? All right, we finished. Okay.  Okay  discussions while we were doing the annotation, did you have stages of clarification or as opposed to did?  about the phrase types and then, eventually you came up with some kind of rules that you set up between the two few hours.  as a spectral feature. We had a long discussion about that. But I don't remember sort of arguing from different sides and converging just sort of piecing out what come up and agreeing what we do. And we had a manual, what you haven't got here. Do you want me to get a copy without be useful? I don't have to leave the meeting now. It's been a long time since we've done this and we get Ben to put this out. Yeah, I think so. Okay. Yeah.  We did something. We did something. We did something. We did something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a cool little count. Yeah. There's a lot of that. Yeah. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  There are the in our areas. Conferencing, haven't they? In the ATC? Yeah, that's right. Although it isn't huge or often these days. I had to fly to Germany to a teleconference. I'm so much here for the ESO interview. And they fly to Germany and put you on a four-way teleconference with many people in Chile. And had they asked, we could have done it fine at ATC. Right. And say, having to go to Germany for the day.  I've got that far. It's a very strange interview feeling, so because you can't see that. Well, you're giving your talk. They just show, usually they have a camera on you and a camera on them. But during the talk part, they have a camera on, I believe them. Because I can see that guy reading a newspaper halfway through my talk. And then they had a camera on showing what my slides were. And so you forget that they can see you at all. And so when all of that was over, they were answering me questions.  I realized I was sitting there in the interview going.  So I had something with without very many. Yeah. Oh, very simple. Not how I was flying in and things. Because that would just make it really difficult. But I practice the talking, standing up in front of it and pointing to things. And you're sitting down in front of it. And you could see yourself, but not only can you see yourself, you see yourself bounce back two seconds later. But I don't really want to chill you back. It is saying that all I just do that. And that you were reacting to what you did, a while ago. It's a really daft situation.  We can start shouting about shall we dive in in the interim? Yes, yes. Continue on flux. Flux. Flux on its own wouldn't be a spectral feature. I think it should probably just be continuing.  I think I'm working out who's tapping bottom. Yeah, I'm happy enough. I actually haven't really thought about like a marking on both marking who's tapping who's bottom. I think maybe that would make sense for you guys to know.  I don't know. I think we've already left it out on purpose, which is recent. Yes. Yeah. And I'm pretty sure I'm body away. I'm pretty sure I'm top. So, okay. Because I would fight for line being a spectacle feature as well. Right. Yeah. I think that's probably right as well. Hard to mark on this. Do that. Okay. Next. So, sorry. I'm just for the convention. You're marking which would... What should I want? The annotation you think is the right one.  And if neither then we'll have to put something else. Okay, so here I'm missing soft component on the bottom. I think that you're probably right soft component is a if you get line I get soft component. Do you think? Oh, I should have been doing probably well, it's not that if it's a reading of the spectrum that I mean can point at it and then it is a  A  to actually something in the absorption of your ceiling. If it was a dip in the absorption for a lack of absorption, you would put in. This is the point to describing those. Yeah, that's the thing you point to. And this is a physical mechanism. So yeah, I'd say. Two down. 250. Next, that's two.  That's definitely too. You're right. This one with your equivalent width. I think you're right there. We weren't going to mark the equivalent width, but we weren't going to mark the lines. I think that's true. Yeah. Ready? Not very missing. Board line. Yeah, that's true. You get that.  I don't remember what we were doing with nebulae. We weren't doing like H2 regions and stuff, right? I can't remember actually. Should we see when many will come so it's come up to that one? Yep, yes. I got my import reading about that either.  We're doing descriptions that made things separate classes in which case I'd argue for a little bit.  It's not a, yeah, it's something you've derived. The power line decks is something you desire, drive, a break and a spectrum is something you can point out. So, you still have to make an a power line decks. I think that's a feature. Because in the spectrum it does that and end as that. That's where it breaks. It's light to pressure the continuum near the limon limit. I think you would, and if I did it again, I'd say slight depression of the continuum in  Well, but we're supposed to say well, but we're supposed to say descriptive words of the features. Yeah, if it was absorption at H alpha, that would all be one or absorb your 5,000 nanometers would all be one anyway Yeah, but they would be the same spectrum feature whereas here there's a lie in limit which you can see and then there's a slight depression near it Yeah, you're right. It's it's near rather than at it's not yeah  Did you have a sense about that? No, you want to split that one then? Are you into two? Yeah, yeah. I'd agree with that I think. Is that cake here? Excellent. Let's go blow my foot. Yeah, okay. Absorption.  That I didn't mark because it's the physical process of absorption. Yeah, not the thing. Tell you it was more a wake of this. Would there be other cases where you would actually mark an absorption or? Yeah, there was an absorption feature or absorption. You see at the spectrum at this wavelength. But when you say, for example, the the quays are  absorbed that just means the quasar is behind a bunch of stuff. Sure. Thanks. So that's describing something physically rather than describing the spectrum itself. Okay. Thank you. There is no steep, soft component below 2KV. I don't remember what we were going to do about things that weren't there.  It's not something you can point to. You could point to it if it were there. Yes, you could. I tend to miss out things if they're too long. But if it had been there, you would have... You would like to... How did I speak?  So the nebula. Was it the nebula? Yeah, so we're saying about nebula.  I think it does. Right. We weren't matching age two regions because it was a region. I think it was there. Yeah. I'll comment for that. Lion again. Lion that's my ratios. I remember we weren't going to mark lion ratios but we were going to mark here where you've got equivalent width of each beta or if it's a...  but ratios differently. In line and line ratios is modifying ratios. Isn't it? I guess it's not talking about specific lines. A line ratio is a thing. Yeah, because I would actually listed explicitly on that you're not going to include it. Right. Don't include line ratios after abundances. Is that the value of the word? Oh, I see what you mean.  Don't it? Yeah. Yeah, I mean you wouldn't have arrived for a day. You wouldn't include abundances or line strengths. No. Yeah. It shouldn't include line in that. Okay. I don't think. Oh, oh. Oh, I see what you're doing. You're circling the one. The one I keep. You're alright. Dump climate alpha. Absorbas. I think that's a spectral feature even though it's... You wouldn't mark the source type.  Sorry, so can you just ask now you just aligned? Sorry you circle the word in the other line which didn't yes because we don't want to underline right, sorry, oh, I see okay Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right, so you can that's a these are source types. I mean it's not a source type, but it's also But he down the now for absorbards are our physical things not spectral features, but you also absorb them by  You observe them by their spectral feature. What are we doing for things? Board absorption line quasar for example. We were marking the board absorption line as well as board absorption line quasar. So I think it should be the same as that if it's defined by a spectral feature we should mark it. But you wouldn't be able to point to something in a spectrum and say that's a damp Lyman alpha absorber unless you'd point to damp Lyman alpha there.  So we wouldn't say absorbers or a type of source. A little specific type of source, but I think still the respectful feature counts even though it's a modifier of something. Okay, I'm not certain about that, but I, why do you reckon about that? Well, when you look at this,  spectrum in spots that Lyman alpha has been damned. But that is a spectral feature. Don't with the damned Lyman alpha, it's over as you see them a variety of places along the line of sight. So you have to know. Yeah, yeah, that's true. How does it work? I don't know what? If you look at a quiz, or you see a bunch of, if you go back to clouds of gas in the way, you can see these things. But you wouldn't be able to point  it one of them and say ah they're gonna be different redshifts but that doesn't mean that you can still say that's damp and I'm not for that, I'm not a stamp by an alpha. I don't know how they do that. They say all of that is damp, I'm an alpha. But you're guessing in a way they aren't you. But isn't that always the case of something that's not particularly, whenever you see them in all sorts of different redshifts it's like the the lime and alpha forest sort of and I'm not certain I would  I would mark that. That's a tricky one. If it was some other spectral feature, then it will open.  We wouldn't mark that source type. But we include modifiers of source type. We wouldn't mark it. But if it was a down climb out of a quasar, then we would mark quasar and we would mark down climbing out of that. Right. Well, there's no option like going to the market. So it's just I guess where the down climbing out is a spectacle feature in itself. Which I would probably be on. So it was but I've never looked at it. I guess it is.  And then it is altering the spectrum as now. I mean, it's changing the spectrum of... It doesn't have to be something that's specific. We say a big blue bump or a soft or a continuum. And we include those. But we weren't going to include descriptions of spectral features that were based on fitting. That's true. We have included how a law though. Have we?  We did steep soft components, and here we included breaking the power law because of the break. Steep soft component, yeah, breaking the power law is something I'm not certain of. Steve's soft component is something you can point at in a spectrum at the same. There's still some degree of fitting in the next year. You know what? What's shallow? It's tricky. That's a bit banana. If we change our mind later and we go through, we can always come back to it and say.  Again, I'd say this is a physical process now. Yeah. And absorption again. Yeah. I don't have K star, but I should do.  What's wrong with Broadway, Jalfa? I think I just missed it, right? I think it's not as if it's, well there's four-width-south maximum, it's still the line within it, yeah.  Okay, all's easy. Silicon 2 is an element rather than a, in this context rather than a line. Is the lines? I guess what you, if my other wasn't in there, then you'd have it silicon 2 lines at without, with the via there, I think that means silicon 2 derived from these two features.  Yeah, I think so too. That's actually an ionic species. It's an ionic species. Yeah, that's true. We're back to it again.  So we haven't got a rule for spectral features within or within types of source. We know we don't. We are. We are not making H2 and H2 regions, for example. And I don't think we are. Because that's not a spectral feature. Yeah, but I guess it's not defined by a spectral feature. Yeah, but I guess it's not defined by a spectral feature. Yeah, but there are two regions where there is a laminar for photos just defined by the definition of laminar for its clouds.  live enough of hosts. But saying that isn't the same as saying we've seen that in a spectrum. Whereas a broad line, Quasar, someone has looked at it and they've seen a broad line. If someone just looked at it, they could just be discussing the physical object, which we aren't marking. Why aren't you marking it then? Because they weren't, I don't know. I don't think we were marking to copy it. The view submission or  It wouldn't count as a source type or well, that's what I'm yeah, yeah, I'm wondering really. Yeah, I remember not marking nebula or clouds Yeah, but this is just one species of cloud it's Abe I'm particular species of cloud not just a general cloud isn't it so Isn't that different  It's a modifier of clouds, but I don't think if we're including the... Yeah. I think we're not including the clouds. I think we're not including the clouds. We can't include... We're above saying maybe we should be including nebulan clouds. Perhaps we should have done, but we haven't, but we haven't. But we haven't. But we haven't. But we haven't. But we haven't. But we haven't. But we haven't. But we haven't. But we haven't.

But we haven't. But we haven't. But we haven't. But we haven't. But we haven't. But we haven't. But we haven  But then we still have to decide if we don't enable the source, what do we do about the spectral features that define that source? If we have, for example, board absorption line object, we mark that. We mark board absorption line in that. That's because we've, to know it's a rather absorption line object, we have seen it. But to know this is a line enough of FOS Cloud, we've seen line enough of FOS.  It doesn't the spectrum of the... But it's still a spectral feature. It might be a spectral feature, but it's a spectral feature in the quasi. That is true. That is true. That is... Let's keep it up. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's gonna be that sorry. Yeah. Okay, so... Laminoth will focus again.  Yeah. And that definitely is a spectral feature on its own, because it doesn't exist. It's post clouds. Each helium tool up to go down. I think that's an element. Yeah, that's derived. Oh, we might the same lines. Excellent. What have we done differently? You've got line brightness temperatures.  We're gonna we're gonna have a lot of these. Yeah, we are and We weren't using line What we didn't do before? Line ratio we weren't doing. Yeah, I don't think line brightness temperatures counts Because it's not talking about a specific line Yeah, so lines okay Line feature  I'm just going to go back to one page. Did you resolve the different segmentations? The main problem was... There's only one difference here. Oh, sorry. I thought it was a problem of like one having underlined the entire... Oh, sorry. No, no. I said, okay. I'm sorry. Quite impressively. Yes. Excellent. What's the same? Damp line now for again. Systems.  I mean, that's a matter of data. But if you said the spectral data, the continuum spectrum. I really don't think that counts. But if you said the time and time and time and time of spectrum, you mark down my mouth because it's in the spectrum and I think data is a good spectrum.  because it's got a spectral feature in the phrase. For example, when we were saying silicon two levels, we didn't mark silicon two. That's because it was still at the spectrum. But if it's saying silicon two line levels, then you will. But what this actually means is we've made some measurements based on damped lime and alpha measurements, and they tell us this answer. And this answer is in the case of being data. Yeah, I don't think that's right.  I'm not sure actually I think I would market And then it is a region of the spectrum and they are actually using region of the spectrum as the data If it's an emission line, but if you both want not to market then fine don't market It was an emission line data would be put in I wouldn't But if it just said emission line we would  the emission line is strong, the emission line data shows strong. I think it's the same actually, I think it's data isn't even needed. It's inconsistent with the damp climate health at more than an epicentacle. Oh, a damp amount of feature. You put a feature there rather than data within your market. Oh, feature absolutely. But I think data is equivalent.  the name the entered recognition task. So I think there was also this one guideline of saying for example of something sitting under a negation, right? There was no damned L, Y, L for something. Then I think the convention was that you still would mark that, right? So it's more like a quite literal task. So it's really like finding these types of strings rather than really referring to the underlying physical reality, which I mean, sort of like if you were to resolve this kind of thing,  cases in order to put them say in a database or so then you'd probably be right in this case, but given that the kind of thing is that this name to any directory is a much it's a much more literal thing like really just finding these kind of strings. I think in this case, I would say this is probably an entity. Okay.  should be damp climbing alpha in red, whatever that is, a spectral feature. And that should be the other tool. Okay, start again, and that's in it twice. Is that clear enough? Yes. Right, source type.  We were including modifiers including board line quays as non board line quays as well. So I think we should probably go flat spectrum video. Video quays are very different from that's true.  speed up, we'll go back. It might be soft ironising continue. You right there I think. See that's talking about the flux of can of ironising photons rather than the absorbent continuum of that spectrum. Yes, I don't like that one. Oxygen should be there. That's not a bit.  I'm happy enough with that.  I don't know why I did that. I don't like that at all. Probably because you were doing 7,000 of use. I couldn't be that I was a bit sleepy. Lines from ions? You can't tell the difference between a line from an ion or a line from something else. Not well, you know where they are in the...  Well I guess if it was lines that H2 yeah, you might like it. That's true That's true. All right Blue wing flux. What are we gonna do about flux?  flax or if it was a blue wing feature with mark feature. Yes it's the amount of stuff in the blue wing. Yeah, so I'm happy with that. Line peak. I think that should be marked. Even though it's done by increasing line peak, it's also done by increasing excess blue wing.  Do you know how to access blue ink flux?  Yeah, I don't think that's a feat here. Okay. There's a system issue again, so we should be consistent. I keep it. Alright.  I think all of us expect one. Feature. It's a way of saying the gunpedism twelfth though. Which if you just said that. Well. It's gunpedism absorption. If it was hydrogen absorption, if not the whole thing. It's hydrogen line you would say.  It's a marks that kind of spectral feature doesn't it? So process isn't it? But so's HB to absorb emission is a process from HB to but it's still this is a process from neutral hydrogen I guess what I mean is neutral hydrogen should be in there and the fact that the computer comes between it It's just a pain Well, I wouldn't have any of it I think I think all of that is just that is  the description of the process. Isn't it? I think I might agree with you. Because this definitely shouldn't be marked. Because that is a process now. Yeah. And if that shouldn't be marked, then that shouldn't be marked. Okay. Let's just cross everything out. What?  Okay, blue shift is absorption. I think it's a modifier of the thing and so probably should be there. Okay. As we put in, we can strong absorption with counts. I think blue shift is shift. Let's talk about the line, isn't it?  So that should be it. Yes. Okay. Anything? Yeah, let's talk about that. I enticed strength for our friend. It's not the abundance of it or any derived property, it's just the strength of the lines. You don't think that it actually is abundance really in a way?  I'm not sure but I guess perhaps it is I'm not sure. Yeah, I'm not sure either. Let's make a decision. I guess it could be a button. Either that, if that shouldn't be in neither should either of those. Yes it's true. I think you probably should then.  narrow line strength. If it's an FV2 line strength we definitely put it in. Yeah that's right. And I think that's what it's referring to even though it's not. Well but it isn't as elemental abundance that you estimate actually using number of lines it isn't just one discrete line in the spectrum as a  What's your name?  Yeah, I don't know if we've marked things like silicon one throughout.  And we would mark it because you talked about the line of it rather than the element. Do you agree with that? I think so. If that's true, then they're leaving out the word line. I don't think should mean that it shouldn't be. The word line should be in there. We know what they mean. I think they mean the line strength rather than the F2 abundance. Well then how about it?  Yes, bloated star. That's what that means. Yeah, okay. Take out mine. And that's just the one. That's just the one colour. This is that. You're right.  Yep, yeah, right. Yeah. And you're right there as well. That's going to be a process. Okay. That couch. Yes, that was when I wasn't sure about because I didn't do phone for it.  Yeah, if it was you lurks you put it in That's just the long name. This should be so interesting. I don't know does those kind of modifiers active we definitely include active? Yes, I guess from his G2 what does that mean?  I don't know what that is.  and filters. But don't we say we don't do that? Ah, I would write, look, it don't include modifiers of regions or systems, e.g. forward line region. You are right systems. That's why I wasn't doing it. And now a line, they're being okay. We just get back to take it out. Okay, we're starting here.  We have got no really marked here.  have the time and just forgotten to use it other times. Just about changing rules. I mean, in a sense, you also want to make sure that the agreement that you arrive on today that they're consistent with what you did before. I mean, this really only displays those cases we disagreed. But if you saw like change a rule now on the flight, then that might create inconsistencies. So I'm sure I followed it all sometimes and just forgotten. So let's take that out.  I'm not sure if I'm missed here. Yeah. But low enough or should be in here because it's not talking about a, it's not modified. Yeah, that's fine. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that. Don't plan on that  Data where they wish you keep him. Okay. Because it's a bit the same as feature. I don't expect to. I think data is the same aspect from because the data is aspect. I still don't like it, but. Final view of I don't have passion. I wouldn't. I think now.  And this one comes out as well. Okay, so we want... Yeah, just crop that out. Alright.  So what were we looking at this page for anyway? It was for something. A child's protection. Broadband protections, isn't, don't include. But I wouldn't, is a half a world line.  With a narrowband detection, narrowband imaging detection. All right, good. I think so. Hf emitters are not a distinct class of source. I don't think no. Just out of curiosity, this narrow broadband that refers to the type of spectrum that you have, like on the type of filter or is it? Yeah, exactly.  I guess if you're picking out a spectral feature even with a board band or now a bad man it's still a spectral feature. If you're picking out a line, yeah, however you pick it out. Yeah, I'm really about to go with line on its own. I think there's a mere lot of those which make less simpler. Okay, right.  This is another system's thing. Yep Absorption profiles. I think the whole thing should actually be marked Even the complex how fast we go? Just Absorption profiles. Yeah, Absorption profiles I go for  Why not? Um... Laminale for first-land, blanketing or laminale for first-land? Yeah, take out the blanketing. That's just... Ah, right.  Is there a system?  This is... Well... The LBI network image. So do they mean the VLBI? There's an all of... This is an instrument if you have it all, isn't it? European VLBI, isn't it? It's an instrument not a research group. Yes, it takes an image. So... Yeah. ...research group, right? Okay, how much of modifiers are we putting in? It's only supposed to be proper.  Which it is yeah, so this whole thing is an instrument 1.6. That's what I think European Oh, I think this Or just from the obi I started with Europe So is this like it's a subset of the way of yeah  Yeah, yeah. Just in Europe, right? There's actually a million and all the international logs in Europe all hooked up into one instrument, basically. Okay. That's a source name, right?  That's just broadband, isn't it, poor animation? Yeah, that shouldn't be marked. Radio loud objects. It's not a... It's not a... It's not a... It's not an original system. We say something about objects. And I think it's that we don't. Anything in object, we don't exist yet.  Now we've both marked line ratios here. Yeah, but we should have done.  And there it's different because you totally don't let me ironize and continue. Yeah, that means which is a process or it's the type of photons. Yeah, you can point to line pairs.  You're right there. There's all one big spectral feature. And Nebula shouldn't be marked. Have you agreed on that? We only agreed that so far we've only agreed that we can't include spectral features modifying Nebula. But I don't see yet where it's written. We did mark Nebula, yes.  It was things that weren't distinct like yeah, but yeah, there's many different kinds of nebula. I think is why I wasn't doing it. Yeah, it's a difficult one. Yeah, I'm gonna stick to it. Yeah, if we're going to have them, that's happened. Oh, yeah. No mind.  Do you like my? You're right. There. Source time. Yep. I like it. I think I know what I could do. We had line blanking just now. We included it. I think it was. Did you? I thought it was a process.  It wasn't included.  Yes, yes, yes, yes. Red and blue components. I think you might know as well. You could say yes. Yeah. Yeah, in the same way that you can point to the soft text waves or  Well I would argue about that you see because I think that you only extract that after actually a modulus but respect of venue. The soft excess you can definitely point to on an X-ray thing. You know if there's one there or not. You can say that. You're saying you wouldn't know it was soft and then you'd go as such. Well yeah. We're talking about the continuum. If you have a galaxy spectrum you can say there's the blue component, there's the red component.  Yeah, oh, so you mean like it comes from adding two different things together. Yeah, that's that's what I'm thinking that I can see that yeah, yeah It's actually really I have to like you model this about from knots just like looking at this spectrum. Yes. Yeah, I give that for red and blue components, but I wouldn't probably give that for soft component Because a soft excess is a I mean that's an x-ray thing like a break  Yeah, but I guess I'm component is means is now when we touch in the model way. Yeah, take out red blue. Which means maybe we should take out soft. Well, it's such a basic sort of you look at a spectrum and you say that's a soft excess. The excess is yeah, but if you modeled it with two parts, well, I had a pony to his nother in soft spectrum.  That's how the little bubble deep feels south. I didn't include it. Although it does apply to the dark. I feel like we're at. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, did we have a soft component earlier? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And you want to remember when? I think I should put you early on out of thoughts.  There it is. Excellent. And right. And then the top one I think you should include. Possibly with flux as well though.  Yeah, that's fine. I'm happy with that. And then... Yes, you're welcome. I've had radio galaxies. Now, what did we say about acronyms where part of it was useful?  Do we make a decision about high-tech radio gags? I think they are discussed as a separate source. Why aren't they? How's the radio gags? Only just interesting because down the hour. And high-tech. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think we're much high-tech in that. Yeah. They are just radio. But yeah.  What do we say about acronyms where? We're part of it's useful. I think you're supposed to mark the whole thing. Yes, I think you're right.  Well people tell you that I don't know. It's pretty stupid. I think they probably are. Yeah. It's just the other ones. Missionized feature we're going to include. Yeah, galaxy, galaxy, formation doesn't. Yeah. And this is one  I  You'll all discover the bed at the invitations, right? Because quite often an object class is defined by a respectful feature. That borderline radio galaxy. Border lines, I think that should go in.  things. Oh it's a yeah. Hi, Paulum and I was going to see. If you're having ultra-lum, I said yeah. Then you have to have hyped in and say yeah. Is it just a color issue? Oh right. And QSO is not. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, you're moving. Yeah. ISM. It's diffuse.  So it probably shouldn't be in there. The ISM isn't a source type. So... No. I don't think so. What were we doing about an episode again? We're now including Navi Arme. Okay. Yeah. We're done. Futurists.  Yes, I took it. Strong dropping the continuum, isn't you right there? Yes. Well, I think you're right again. That's just the place. We aren't doing a machine line on, Jack.  the question is, are we missing line objects except for class of source? I think they are. But are you arguing not to have anything with objects in it? Yes. Yes. You right. And see if it galaxies should be one here. Yes.  That's pretty good. That's still your third. And your speedy up as well I think.  Great, thank you. Smile for the camera. I think it should be a break for Ash. It's a bit of a KML goo. I think it should be a break for Ash.  And I don't know what to do with the HTML goo. But the... This is lambda. Yeah. And this isn't a separate thing. So I would agree that you are the lambda. Of course it is. You underline the goo in the case, but not the end. Yep, right? Directing the stands for lambda. Or... Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. What's different?  Just this. Hi, excitation emission lines. I think high excitation should be in because it's just saying. Just talking about the species. I'm putting the mission out of it's coming from. Yeah. Okay. All right, you don't get that.  I think maybe lost a tea. I don't think it's instrument. The so is it. Your right. We agreed for to keep Hubble. Yes, to keep Hubble. For this. That should be the first time.  It's... Yeah, it's the whole name. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah, I think it was... Yeah, I think it is all. Absorbent 9 systems shouldn't be there. Absorbent 9 systems. And again. Yeah. Right. And it's until my column density is...  Yes. Which is a derived property. Yeah, this is a species of ions again out there. Yeah, that's fine. Individual lines. And the line out of the flower should be in any way. No, for some reason I seem to just die to this.  You got a port. You're right there. I forgot to keep track of the overall score like whom is the only thing. Yeah, she's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her.

She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of her. She's so proud of  It is, but is a mission line AGN a separate class from AGN I don't think it is. I think AGN a mission line AGN you wouldn't get a agent without a mission lines, but I don't think you particularly class the Masera separate source it's a source class I think in the newspaper he does doesn't it? The paper I pointed you to a few weeks ago last week  I didn't mean it. I didn't know what it meant. I've seen people talk about those separate classes that I don't really know what that means. I guess there is a difference between an idea with a mission that ends one without, especially if it's X-ray detected. Yeah. So, yeah, I'm happy with that as long as that's read as well. Which it is. Oh, Galactic Stars.  I think you're right again there. Cheedworth. Cheedworth, sir. Does he want to please? Yes. I don't know what it is. Well, there's one of them out over here. Right, your son. There you go. I saw it yesterday. And pasta, you. Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  I can't remember why I decided to mark associated. What do you mean? It means it's associated with some physical thing, but it doesn't have anything to do with the spectral features. What is associated with the absorption? It doesn't say it's associated with the process. Is it in a process? I don't know. I've got no idea what it means.  I'm happy to say M2, not absorption is a spectral feature. Yeah, but associated means it's associated to some physical thing. Yeah. Okay. So that means then context. And associated again. Those are mechanisms so they don't count.  Yeah, we should do. But we're not supposed to mark things we've done differently. So, yeah, we did that the same. But it's different from what we've been doing. We just talked about... One thing. ...clundalining features. You can actually mark it if it isn't altering what's in the manual. I would say any old thing earlier rules.  Yeah, and it's not in the answer. It doesn't say any manual about features or not, but when we saw one's previously remarked features, yeah, then they were thinking. Yeah, it's the only problem. It's them. If we both have been not marking it, there might be other instances in the text where it's not marked. Yeah, but well, within the sentence that you're sort of currently looking at, I'm free to correct it that way that you do like it's not only about  of like coming up with a corrected version. Right. Okay. Do you've seen the other one there, the quasar right here? Yes. And this is exactly the same as last one. The systems. I am galaxies. Is it kind of a regular galaxy? Yeah. Okay.  Just what you're doing there, sorry. How about you field is being marked? Absorption is being marked. I don't think able class is different from cluster. Enable classes, just because it's explicitly in here not to have able class  Yes, right. So yeah. Soft excess. That definitely gets to go in. That's not a component. Nope. I'm not talking about the access. I agree. I hope you can't blow. Yes, you will. You're right because that's extended emission and cop to emission. Okay. I think you're right in both of them. Yeah. Okay.  X-ray B-L-X and radio B-L-X I think because the B-L within should be marked. Yeah, I agree. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.  I think that's a species again. Yeah, that's fun. I can agree with taking that out.  Because it's a real good, the board line meeting, we're not supposed to highlight it. It's the same, it's just it's not way. It's badly written. It was so cool. And for red glasses we said, mark things based solely on... So I just find only by wavelength, so we can't include a correct galaxy, just galaxies.  Oh, yes, excuse me, it's talking about star-best galaxies rather than star-best within a galaxy. But the other best star-best galaxies there. And galaxies? Continue or continue on flux. It's another one of those that doesn't really make us a difference. Really matter. I'd take into turn your flux, but I'll be...  In most of these cases we put flux in it. Yeah. Okay.  But you kind of you've got a spectrum that's split by yeah, otherwise light yeah, yeah, well I think I would actually leave it and with only use it on those portal Line in it. I'm assuming that's a thing. Yes, okay, yeah, yeah, okay  I know what was marked here. Have you got the bottom of this page? Nice. We're missing week, we climb. So they're saying week line radio galaxies are a separate class of radio galaxy. No. I said that week line was because the modifier should be included, which I think you should. Even though we plan radio galaxies, this should be in the line, this should be green. Actually, sorry, I think there's cut up page  continues at the next. Okay, are we the same on the bottom? Yeah, characterised but unused leave. Okay, so the question is... No, is it? No, you've got lines. Different to any weak lines. Oh, the line, that's fine. Line comes out and and should come out as well and should come out. Oh yeah. So there's a line there, but I think weak lines should be in. And an end. Okay. The same way we have broad line, it will be in there. That's okay.  I just made that up. And gave an acronym to the H-C.  I've got emission line in the ratios, that's fine. And for red galaxies? Yeah, it's right again. Oh no, it's not, it's not right. Yeah. The item-mitting gas, I don't like. Yeah. Far in for red galaxies we can't have. That's it, okay.  We hear Mission Feature which we are including now. That's okay.  That should be because it's not an absorbance absorption. No, but it says it's a physical thing. Yeah, it's a process.  This feature? Yeah, okay. Is a feature respectful feature? No. Okay. Dumped lime alf is again. Yeah, you don't get that. Okay. Bazzers, those are regions, squabs. Yeah, they'll be there. And the vest is the same. Yep. No, a line should be in. Yeah.  X-ray be relaxed. Yeah, that's okay. Intermediate types. Yeah, we put in total and we take them tight. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That doesn't go in. That's okay. Oh, it's just like a system.  And we don't like that one. And we don't like that one. Yeah, that's okay.  Yes, but you just every time Keeping lines there. Yes, so in general every time there's been line Okay, it's line with but it's still with us lines we had an age as well. It says line ratios. We've been taking out line as a word  I agree that that's a fitting thing. I'm not the whole thing there, so our future is in the UV spectrum. Or in the UV, I don't expect we should be there. But if it's a wavelength for a waveband,  Okay.  You'd say line wings. Alright, you get it. That's just a new win. I've clipped them. Yep, no, that shouldn't be in there. Yeah, you're right there. You're right, stop this. Oh, starburst activity. Starburst like activity.  It's a class. It's an action. Yeah, but then the AGN like I do it. Yeah. But it has to go. An AGN is a class. A star bus class. A star bus is a type of galaxy, but it's also something that can happen within a galaxy. But an AGN is an object. A star bus, you can't say, but we're counting star bus. A star bus galaxy. We're trying star bus if it means galaxy. If this means star bus galaxy like activity, that's no.  Starburst Galaxy is only a galaxy which has a starburst in it like an AEG, an active galaxy is just a galaxy with an AGN in it. But Starburst refers to... From the linguistic side, if you mark Starburst before and if you feel that Starburst are like objects, then I think it should stay in and it's even though it's modified by activity or it's modifying it to the edge. Okay, let's keep it in. I think you're right there. You have to both stay and go.  Yeah, I think it was maybe for the staff forming. I get to do it with different. Yeah, it's our formation we weren't putting in. Yes, that's right. But starburst. Okay, we've just got this split up. I think I should be. Thank you. Your edges too. It's a wavelength region. It's still for region, but you're saying between that line and that line. Yeah. Okay.  You are, yes. Let's hope I'm in there. Line wishes? I think. Need for red galaxy. It's time for galaxy. But galaxy should be in. But galaxy should be in. So we need to write that. Right. Hold on. Oh. Oh, no, the other same. So here is that.  social line systems, and Hubble and Galaxy. Galaxy distribution. Still the distribution of Galaxy.  That weirdiest spectrum. Yes, don't include flats spectrum. Quizzas? Yeah, that counts. Low ionization. Oh, we go through, we should be in.  The lobels, aren't they? The lobel is a separate class of source. Yeah, that's true. I don't know if high bells are but lobels are. They are. It's a big joke. Alright, yeah. Next. You're right there.  Yeah, the emission line counted it that means objects that are identified in a particular red surface. I don't yeah Continuum I think should be in Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,  Okay. Yeah, we went to import and detections. We were doing, yeah. Nice teeth. Mind too. Now what we're doing if radio lag quasar should be in, Z equals two shouldn't. And what we're doing was to leave it in, was it?  I don't know because you would get in language speak about each condom to accept identity. That's different. Yeah, that's for things marked with and. Mark's subsections of entities. No, that's different. It doesn't really say, it doesn't say. So we need a rule for that.  Z equals two. So that shouldn't be in but radio loud quasar is a thing. So it's whether to include the z equals two. If it was radio loud quasar then you would mark it as one thing. Yeah. I think it makes sense to mark the whole thing then as one. I don't know what you like. What's whatever's easiest for you?  No, yes, take it out. The spellful components. No. Exway by noisem. Hopefully, field again.  That's the time. Yeah, that's right. They do work and not the other. And you're right because one's line formation and one's line profile. Yeah. IDM, I've done it again. Right. Is it nice and easy? Yes.  Yeah. Components. Yeah. Um, we can get rid of that, can't we? Yeah, I think so. But we want the lines to turn. The galaxy or galaxy? The galaxy. The galaxy. It should be the galaxy. It should be the galaxy and so proper, whatever there. What it is.  I don't know what HBC stands for but since there are complexes we can cross down. Do you know what HBC does? No, to lie in the direction of a high velocity cloud. That's right. Yes, but it looks like an ICM. Excuse me. That's an instrument.  times, anyway, when it works. You're right there. Should be this and it probably is. Nobody know your rights and this should be read as well. It should all be. Oh, I see. Yeah. Now, I need you in a different. I missed out that. It's a little bit of a line with.  I don't think that matters very much. Just keep H.B. to I think. Given that we're not putting line with itself. Even line of it is a plan with. You can have flax.  No, not that line, but we want enhanced. We wanted, this is relative, we wanted modifiers of, what if I was a spectral lines, E.G. weak board lines?  But enhanced relative to what? We quite relative to what though? It's all relative, but it's still a modifier of that line. Okay. And the same. Sorry, the AGN, I think there should be one entity right there. Wasn't it according to the acronym rule, the first one? Yes, that's right.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  should be in there. Okay. We're including emission. Are you? Yeah, extended emission is extended. We've not been including extended emission. No, that's true. So we should not have the unease or the best. But then we will make some levels is just a way of doing it. Yeah. Okay. Nothing at all.  Oh, yeah, that's right. Yeah.  doing component. Oh yes. This is this is a radiative transfer thing. So they don't mean they mean photons in the lines escape. Not that that's not something you point to. Yes, that's true. So see you too again, which means. Continuum source shouldn't be in.  And I suppose you didn't be there. CTIO. That should be. Oh wait, is that what does it stand for? That's for the observatory, is it? Yeah. The CTIO 4 meter. That is a set of italics. Yeah. Well, the nine. Yeah. And the AITs in observatory as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, but it's also a telescope. And I think if there's no other way of describing it, that telescope.  The CTO for me to telescope is must be what is called otherwise the call it a name The Blanco actually usually I don't mind if we we're including observatory if it's part of the proper name of an instrument Yeah, I think but then we have to go for meter as well. Yeah, yes, I was good. No, just for me. Yeah  I  Yeah.  for QSS. It's not a source that's definitely true. Yeah. That's okay. DAWD. There's WD's. It's 25 of DA type in safety. Yeah, it has hydrogen or helium in the atmosphere. Okay, so it is a different class.  No  Yeah, no absorption lines that should be highlighted. Also him. Yeah, low luminous secures. People talk about them a lot. Yeah, I did all the luminous galaxies. Yeah, so we should do. I guess you should keep it then. Yeah, people don't need to think. There's as much as ultra luminous galaxies.  Okay. No absorption lines should be in. And the same here. I didn't know to do associated ones. It's not. Regent. I should have done that. Yes, you shouldn't. Oh, A and B. And we...  Sure we can do that. That's the Kanjang rule. I'm right here I think. Yes you are, that's yeah. Strong soft x-ray flux. Yeah. That's associated absorption lines. Right. In the AAL outline. That doesn't count.  And absorption in small clouds, except if that's a count. Now this is the contract we'll again. Blue wings and this and this. And this is one double line and this and presumably that's red there. I think if the line's too long, you guys don't have one.  $1, right? And I finally said that seperin it should be separate. Okay. What's this end thing? Because there's not marked in the... I think if the line is too long, it's only between the bottom line because Olivia would have marked from blue all the way to the end is one long line. No, sorry. I mean, so it's a more than I can at the end as well. Yeah, I think it probably wasn't just as printed because Olivia wouldn't have started marking at 40.02 on the two lines above.  Yeah, but I think it's just missing out the printing if the line goes over the end. Oh, I see. Because if you look at your end, what an obvious done here. Yeah, I see. Olivia wouldn't have just had that line. Right. He would have had like the whole thing. Yeah. So you're mostly setting for the solution where you mark all contracts. Yes. And it just hasn't printed that. Yeah. But it is marked, I think. Right. So opponents don't count.  Continuum source? Shouldn't be. That's right. Is that also the name of the source? Probably. Yeah. So it should be this one plus the pink.  Line for honest, and I think that should be in that's a way of saying line with though, and we don't mark that way well, okay, yeah So we've been in here  You probably write to the feature of the spectrum Does that make it a spectral feature? Something that you can point to a writer? Well, kind of it's I did you had a suspect we have all the lines of actually lots of different elements  And you have to work out at all the ones with your iron lines. Then after that you look and say, has a lot of iron in it. And to feature the whole spectrum of the black, you can't see there is a rich iron aspect. You can see this is a rich iron spectrum. Yeah, so that's like a derived property. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  And then we're the same. Okay. Gosh, we can't see this now. Yeah. We're going to make it to our second cookie. Um, giant elliptical or ellipticals. We're wearing mine. Are you in our giant elliptical separate things? I don't know. Yeah. They are separate, but they're separate class. I think they probably are in the east of Peter's. These are the main gas.  I  Okay, if you may think so. Yeah. Well, I'm not certain if I excitation should go in but if I excitation should go in I think I know has been the same thing. Yeah, okay. Line ratio Yeah, oh back up yes resource are 117 Now I line to see if it won't  she'd all be one with the red inside it. This is describing the band, you do the observations and just equipping the line you're looking for. Yeah, that counts. I think so. We've included it before when you've said this has been detected. Right, right.  I think should be in this. Yeah, okay. Quasas and estu. Oh, that shouldn't be there, should they? No. It's not systems, yeah. Okay. Okay. Well hang on now, but...  I'm just describe your mechanism there. It isn't natural. No, I think it's a special feature. You can point to the dam climate of absorption. And the same thing, you can point to HB to emission, although HB to emission is a process. I think we should just make these discoveries out before, isn't it? No, dam climate of absorption systems, we crossed out. We also crossed out.  I think it's a process too. I think especially when they're saying we're choosing low redshift absorption. You can put to low redshift down planet off. I'm sorry, you're shifting in the spectrum there. I'm not too fast, I don't think.  What did it be if it was HB2 absorption? And you just took out the redshift. Quizzas with HB2 absorption you'd put in. I'm not sure because it's a spectral feature. I think Dan Kliman-Alf absorption. That's where there's a processor of feature. But I think it's better.  Yes, it means with low redshift and plant alpha cloud absorption. If it was time for absorbance, that would be different. But I think absorption. I do think it's a process. It's a process, but it also produces a spectral feature. Where you can say there's the dumplime and alpha absorption. Yeah, well, that's true. In the same way that, you know, HP2 emission is a  Yeah, I think that should be in there.  Yeah, I think you're right, they have me. On the other hand if we're having hyperluminous galaxies, where they've just gone overly luminous, no even more hyperluminous. Yeah, well someone must have made that up for the first time. But do they, what defines a microchaser? I'm saying there's a hyperluminous galaxy being very, very extreme. But I guess keep it, probably.  I reckon a dwarf a more of a snyke I start with that one. I think that one is a... Yeah, there's not been more than one study of dwarf a more of a snyke starverse galaxy. So that... Do we say we take that out? Yeah, okay. But what about the acronym? Because that... Yeah, that should be an...  Starburst nuclei. You're like, oh, the object. If it was Starburst galaxies, it would be in there. Starburst nuclei refers to a region with an object which would not be observed separately. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's fine. So what happens now? So you found that dwarf amorphous, nooblog, galaxies, that's on the proper name.  but you still include the acronym or? Because the acronym has starburst in it, the galaxy's in it, and the S and the acronym includes it. Alright, okay. It has to be in there. Continuing flux you can have. You, the end optical emission line. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm  You've been optical emission shouldn't be in there though. No, it shouldn't. No, it shouldn't. No, it shouldn't. Okay, so I've highlighted this in red and then the whole thing in green because type 2 supergalic season 1.  We weren't doing the board of intersections yet. Using the WIPL F, that's definitely an instrument. It is, yes. Very stupid, but it is.  right there. FBS objects shouldn't be in there. What does it mean? I don't know, it's called objects. Yeah, you're right. And the mama scanning machine is an instrument. It's not a telescope, it's an instrument. Do you even have that? Right. The other one we stopped after a 4 meter? Oh, yes, it should be.  Now emission lines from high, let me do it. Let's wait before. Absolption features. We continue. Yeah, let's be separate. Continue in radiation.  Neither. Neither. No line region emission. Yep. Oh, that's emissions from the no line region. Yeah. Yeah, we don't. No line emission should be in. Yeah. White course is a source.  SB low balance or so, I'll start typing. Yeah, all right. Stupid there. Maybe I can kick his. Oh, no, kick up servitry. Yes, we did side kick. Kick is going in. We didn't allow iron spectrum, so we shouldn't allow each. Or helium to a spectrum either. Yeah, that's right. At all. Yeah, we shouldn't allow a mission. Yeah.  Yeah.  I think no separate class yes we're not putting them in spectral but I think we are putting them in because it's a so board band but yes they are separate.  No, you can't point this, yeah. Miss Group, my dad, my screw. See, we would tell the scope here, right? That's it. Hey! Hey, whoa! It's under a proper name because it's got a capital T. Yeah. Well, how are you getting? One of them. One of them. Under two hours. Excellent. What's we got them identified? A lot of them were  same problem going round and round. Where's the bin in here? And more to the point, can I get to it without... How are you in my little bits of water with me? Excuse me, camera. I just had a bin. And there was one as the... Do we need to remain wider or we're done? I think so, yeah. We're done. Excellent.  Melissa no  I'm not the main player that will listen to this next thing. I'm just going to have a cycle.  Yeah, so we've moved over on to the other eye links. Yeah, I mean she's running in the mind you on this was that The need for people to back up their data personally was made sufficiently clear to lab users I mean I guess it did miss it right Okay, I'm just thinking you know sometimes when there's a process arrow like that you think over them There's something we should change like make the sign in bigger red letters But in the our case, I don't think there's anything more we can do really  No. Well, I doubt anybody will do that again because that will get around. Yeah, we'll look at the mailing list up now isn't it? Yeah, there's a mailing list. There's no that, isn't it? Yeah, there wasn't a mailing list before. They just revived that, right? Frank went through it, deleted the people that were have gone or whatever and replaced them so that the list is now updated. Yeah, so everyone will have been reminded. Yeah, don't store anything.  you care about on the menu. Right. And we don't know. So there's a retented the spelling over again if it's a hardware thing. Right. And there's not much we can do about that apart from. Yeah. And they do hard drive check and remember we check and it says there's no problems. But something comes together wrong in the first place. We don't know. We don't know. We don't know. Just fingers crossed in hope. And yeah, how the whole this is just a software thing that we can just fix like that and that'll be it. Yeah. So how long does this put you back for?  Is it you know how much disruption does this cause does this a day? Do you need a bit? Yeah, but the time everything yeah, and then it'll be hopefully no more than I don't know what 20 minutes today Yeah, I mean, so well one one one one one we'll try and get done today Yeah, get windows back on there trying to get campaigns around there and get that tested out and then that'll be I think that's everything we need before we can start with the experiment system Yep, and I saw a bunch of stuff about software updates That's unrelated to this problem, right?  You mean from... I didn't read in myself like five messages go back and forth. Maybe they were under the wrong subject header. So anyways, we have... Nothing over the last week. Joe has produced another version of the model builder. Oh, no, I mean the I like software. Well, that was through a few weeks ago. So it's unrelated. It's not that... It's unrelated. Okay, good. And was running his Frank...  did all that because he then had an experiment so he's run an experiment. So did he get his data? Is this put his schedule back? He's done his course. He's done it. Okay. And he backs up. Right. Well, unfortunate, but it sounds like you guys are well placed for dealing with it. But you would be.  You know, at the moment you get things working on Monday. So everything went down on Tuesday morning. So my manager gave everything working on the, yeah, on Monday to show that JCT is actually working, collaborating between the two machines. I had dinner, I was actually, I didn't have the eye track and stuff working because it was just me running around and running around the lab. So I have the ones that's reinstalled, have to actually do a proper problem. So you need to borrow somebody's head and mouth and stuff to run it, right? Yeah. But it looks like it was doing all the calibration and drift correction things that  So that's something to add to the software for that part.  She's actually climbing Ben Nevis today. She'll be back tomorrow. Her name's Ninka. Did you guys meet her?  Oh, yeah, hi. Oh, yeah, she's good. You guys might actually have something in common because she does well, you know stuff in video coding and gesture. Yeah An autism. Okay Okay, I will actually give it the option but It's on slick the kind of thing where you know  It's quite useful when you're at that stage to see the different kinds of technologies people use.  out properly. So I should make that slightly easier. The bleep was a hardware bleep originally and so it comes from the PC which is outside the same proof box. Oops. Well you've found that. Yes. But yes, the proportioner is because on the miters inside the room so as long as and what I've done I'll just get it set up. So whatever the asterisk stand is and windows is what gets played.  So you can just change the sound to whatever you like, just through the Windows control panel. Okay, so we want one, you can pick up using MATLAB or something, right? Yeah, yeah, so I had that running over the weekend. So last week I tried it with a one kilohertz sound and it was, it could detect it, but it wasn't, but it wasn't very clear. Did it with 10 kilohertz and it's just really clear. We can tell exactly exactly where exactly where the video is. Perfect. So yeah, so it's just a matter of, yeah, you just basically just play 10 kilohertz sound over the,  over the speech and then just compare the two signals basically. So I've got a little script for doing it. Perfect. So you're going to bank the script someplace. Tell us how to run it. Yeah. Because we won't know. Right. Well, that all sounds good. What else? You have altered the task program. You say to put the little eye icon in the mouse. Yeah. The one in Justin's tools should have that now.  double-jacking on the on the my tracking machines, but yeah, it should be updated with that now rather than just a blob and one did something more like an eye so that you that was the eye. Oh, really? Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah, so that's so good. Like a big circle with a white circle in the middle of an eye and they've got like a rectangle with two like rectangle buttons on it for a mouse. Oh, okay. So very nice. Very pretty. It doesn't get in the way of seeing what's underneath.  No, the same size as the original is a lot of space. So they are the most slightly bigger, but it's not hugely bigger. I can see where that's useful. And if it ever gets the very problem in the pilot, I can easily reduce the size of whatever. That's not too hard. Want a reasonable size so that if they're looking at it, we know they're looking at it. So it has to be a reasonable target for the tracking purposes. Although if you had a big thing and it was jiggling around  like anybody's business like real life track traces then you might find that a little bit disconcerting I mean small things you kind of expected you go out there yeah I suppose a larger more oscillation appears it's not I mean it isn't that big so it's like it's quiver yeah well that's all fine what else you're saying Joe  the model builder. Yes, he's produced another version that doesn't have the overlap problem. Oh, yes. The collision. So, polygons now don't overlap. Oh, that's good. Marlou has discovered something strange about the orientation of parallel diagrams from when it was constructed to when it appears in the actual task. But I think that might be something to do with the original  configuration and the parts that weren't the same across the two so I'll check that out to see if it really is a problem or not. Basically the parallel diagram was appearing in a mirror image of what it was like in the model builder. Yeah, just totally flipped in a mirror image not rotated so it wasn't anything to do with rotation. Just the parallel diagram. Yeah, just the parallel diagram. So not entirely sure. It must be some way of how the vertices  to describe or define it one way or compare it to something else. Right. Okay. So your job in this is to ensure that it actually is a bug and then pass it to Joe. Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. I mean, this geometry stuff is really tricky if you don't do the full box. It's stuff in your head well. So I can imagine. Well, as I could get it backwards easily, you know, so it is just a small key. The other thing we've done  And then as looked at not for this current experiment, but for future when we've got to build and preserve parts like aircraft wings and things, something like X-Vig can output the vertex points for creating the actual polygons in the first place. Because the motor builder assumes that there's an existing state of a region. So you need to draw them in the first place.  that a reasonable thing to do.  I know, I know. I know a don't be in things have packages that do it both of it like if you're a pack. So I'll be very surprised there wasn't the free package for doing it. I'll have a feeling that the MAA, the W3C browser, does it have a feeling that that can actually edit SVG files. So I wouldn't do any work to try and find out what'll put SVG just ask them, look, you know, say,  You need to think that does SVG and then if they if they come back and say ha Then you may need to put around a bit looking for something. Yeah, you know let them let them say They've got a problem before you have spent time trying to figure out what'll do it Yeah, it's not an immediate problem anyway, but I thought it was worth before it jule disappears just checking that the motor builder is not restricted to just doing the time grams or something So it does look like it's oh so well I can imagine  There being shapes that you could construct in a SPG format that would fox the model builder in some way. I don't know. I mean, because you don't have specs about what sorts of shapes are allowed, right? No, but as long as there's solid polygons, it should be right. Right. It doesn't matter whether they're convex or concave in a funny way. Well, hopefully that's not what the panel diagram problem is because it does have some angles and things.  No, I created a convex part just the next big. It just happened to be a convex part that I was playing with. It hadn't large fun. It didn't have any self-intersections, so that might be a problem. So I'll have to check that. But...  to have a central point anyway for rotation.  Yeah, so if I were just to do the non-insecting and yeah, there's this the most the SVD stuff can out for ones which aren't closed polygons but once it was actually a turn-off in the parts list it greater close polygon bush by linking the end. Yeah, so yeah, so there's a song with the  I'm not sure if I can.  like, create my great output slightly different from the next week. Well, let's encourage them not to use any software that might have any other some credit ideas about what SVG is. She says, delicate looking. The Microsoft version of this 50 years. I'm like, no, no, no. I have no idea whether they have videos of credit, SPG output or whether. But the track record on some of the other standards has not very, have been slightly strange things.  But in Maya, you know, I mean, that should be. That should be fun. Yeah, I think it does SVD, A-V-G output. So I can use a double check if no main can't find anything. Yeah. I haven't looked through other mail. I did see something from my loose. Is there anything they're waiting on from us that is a problem or they wouldn't be happy at the moment?  They're not waiting anything from us. They've dumped the pilot the pilot studies that they generated based on the task with their English participants. Oh, they're just pilots. Oh, good. But they haven't done anything with it other than dump the data. Where is it? Well, they dumped it on the BS. Well, you serve it, but I moved well, I haven't moved it. I copied it onto the. Well, that's okay. You know, we're not using that much  I don't know if that ever got resolved.  again to register for the CSV and what the CVS and what to do and the software I use it seems to be quite easy. Oh so you're managing that okay and you haven't run into CVS before? No. Okay. Well yes no as in yes it's new and no. Yeah yeah yeah. Well that's that's really hard. So far yeah yeah. Of course he's sitting on the next desk. Yeah and I am just using it through a Windows  Yeah, but that was that you have to install there wasn't it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  Yes from home when I was working with home last last week and what does that actually can match to get in and just just check the stuff and make sure it was all Make sure to make sure I could access it so they shouldn't have any trouble accessing it once I've got to log in Right and what about the project as a whole is there anything that  We are not going to be ready for the first time.  The group is a whole at the moment. I've sorted out travel etc. to Munich. Oh yeah. For Ellen, John and myself. We're all off on the 14th of December. Going back on the Friday season. And John's going. Yes. That's good. You'll be useful for the WP7 stuff. Well, why you do that? I'll be trained in how to hire people.  So that's sweet. Hope to hire or hope to interview that. Both. So. So is there anything else? What have you got on for the rest of the week besides getting this stuff up and running again? Well, one to one to try to the CamTager stuff. I'll see if there's any problems going through that trying to fix them. There's any problems next time I'm working on this GDF stuff.  Yeah, so I've put on a DTD and some black female file on the wiki for the GDF. But based on some stuff you put on the GDF specification. So are you concerned about it that I should be looking at it or are you happy with it? I mean I sort of wrote the initial draft of it I suppose. Yeah, I changed a couple of things from your original draft. So there's no longer a separate thing for creating new parts. So just put a start and end time on each part.  You had a thing called, I think it was mold, or something easy you said, which is sort of a great new part. It was an action to great new part. But I gave each part a start time in an end time. So you can see when the parts were created. So I'm not sure if you want to keep the mold or not. I'll have to look, I can't remember how this works now, because it was a while ago. Yeah, it's just the GDF specification page on the wiki.  I tried a bit in justification for the change that I made on the page. I was sent out for review. So anyone who's going to be using the format can have a look at it. Yeah. And you'll get nothing back unless I look at it. So best for a friend to do that. Yeah. I mean, it's really good that you're putting things out for review and saying like, why for stuff. But we also don't want to burn too much of your time  recording stuff that nobody's ever gonna look at necessarily. So, I mean, this might be a good case for it. Or it might be that you should just like, you know, have talked to me about the stuff if I happen to be around at the time that you're doing it and not. So, if the writing stuff down on the wiki gets to be too high a proportion of things, then you don't necessarily wanna do it. You do what I mean. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, I think it's great to have the records and that's really important, especially in  in big dispersed groups, but this is kind of a smaller group. So, you know, we can do things more informally where we feel the wickies are getting in the way of things. Yeah. Well, the one that's saying it was telling me, it's helpful for me to put it up on the wickies because I could actually think about it as I put it up and say, well, this is why I want to do things this way. Oh, yeah. Well, if it aids you in thinking to write it down, then definitely write it down. Yeah. Because, yeah, we want clear thinking. I can't actually remember how it worked with the most  I wanted to make sure that No, I can't even remember so I'll look at him Yeah, fair enough, fair enough, but I'm sure it's fine because it's just my memory of things I'll have to get to groups with cramp campasia and properly Yeah, to generate a little sort of introductory Video I suppose for instructional purposes at the beginning of the experiment so people will be able to see  And so the example movements and things of that will be. Yeah. So is that going to have a voiceover? Or is it, we have discussions before you started about whether it should be completely silent so that they could use, in case we ever wanted to do this in Dutch as well. And so you could just have sort of, well, I think we discussed having it with an English voiceover, having it with no voiceover, and then having it just with kind of  to  the  Just having Or did no no no I think it's probably yeah, or ding. Yeah, you got it. Or probably actually not even the sign to fix because otherwise to look spec that in the real experiment And that doesn't happen. Yeah, yeah, yeah So they make move a piece and it breaks and they don't hear this crash and they go what's you know That really will what happened yeah, well you need some way to make sure that they  You can actually notice the thing you're trying to explain to them if there's no voice.  and whatever. Well yeah, I'll show them a bit of a quick, big aerosol, whatever. So you're going to clear over however you do this without one, right? Because she's the one that has thoughts about the language and stuff. Yes, but in our discussion we haven't mentioned, it was assumed to be a voiceover. But... Well, we might take a question about what we're talking about. I'll do that. Yes, because we've got to think of the instructions and basic introduction to it all as well.  Actually, I did email Naimagan to ask if they had a save instructions they'd given their. I just I lose just talk to a probaball. I suspect so exactly to reply back. I think it's very up to us to. Yeah, it was just in case they had something that you don't want to give them the specification, you know, because that's in too high for the language, but it can't be that hard to generate something.  I should be straightforward enough.  Actually, I could probably just for typical people manual. Oh, so it's so tactile. I have little metal bits if you're using it keep it. He's got plenty of toys if you're not if you're not using it, then I'll think it back Right Hopefully well hopefully need it more than another week or two anyway So it's not a worry the lad has plenty of toys and looking at the complexity sort of aspect of the  It's not quite that they just get harder. It's kind of have pages of similar types. Oh, similar types. Yeah, so one page, you'll have parts that are kind of similar to each other and then you move over in a different, almost type of designer style. Yeah. So it's not quite as progressive in complexity. Right. So how are you going to get your complexity ratings? Google.  Google is there a big tan gram community that ranks these things like you know that's just one booklet became with one set of tan rounds I'll try I'll try never know what's what's obvious like when you look at these things well I'm hoping the Dutch input will allow us to sort of have a rough idea of what is suitable complexity yeah but that still won't tell you  Well how many ten grams out there that they're using 15 minutes ago? No, no even that the of this relevant type to what we're wanting to use probably three to generate 16 and total So that's not gonna tell you anything about relative complexity. That's just gonna tell you where in the span you want to be You still need some kind of scale for these things. Yeah, if you look at them, do you just know? No, well I don't know  What about him? No. Mr. Geometry. Can you tell us by looking at these how hard people are in the world? I wouldn't know. I'll try the Google and see if there are some sort of ranking sites. In psychology, I already use these temgrams that still around. People have been using temgrams for ages, so there must be somebody with a folk wisdom youth in contact.  I don't know if I'm sorry. Right, I only know agent papers. So like late 80s Do people still use diagrams? I've not encountered them. So we're very old fashioned. Maybe they just don't use anything like that. Well, there was stuff in the 70s and the 80s, right? But I'm not sure if anything's happened since then. Right. Wow.  the old tasks in the best. So I'm not gonna let that worry me. So, sorry, that was, I figured big diversion and we were talking about what you were gonna do next after all this stuff was up and I was gonna look at the GDF spec. The rest of the, is the rest of what you to do with that software fairly clear? Because this is about the analysis. Yeah, yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I thought it was just what Robin and what analysis we need to get out of the GDF format. So I'm gonna basically, I've got the just analysis, got the basis for a ASCII to GDF converter. So what I've got to do is actually create an output, a GDF output, part to it. Because the amount of any outputs the video, but it does have Intel structures, which will make it easy to do the XML. So that's what I've got to look at. And then once I've done that, I can look at the whatever analysis we need to get done out of the GDF.  Yeah, because the world is issues about how you calculate I like and you know what other analyses we want out of this that aren't settled, but I think Robin is the person who knows the most about what's required there and I could imagine it's gonna take a little while. I could imagine you know, so that might be the focus of discussions next week or something right that Yeah, to try and get out of this home in parameters and choose the right sector.  Yeah, so you might want to try and come if you get that far try and come equip for the list of the kinds of things you want out of it and so we can look through and see. Alan might have views on what kinds of things once we have a list. Right. So I'm sure she'll abuse on it. Yeah, so but if you could to make sure once we have a list of the things that we think we're getting out of it that matches her intentions for what we were supposed to get out of it. So you know, if we do talk about that then it might be nice to have her  along for it. Oh, I found it physically yet, but a reference to a 92 paper, it's in the royal proceedings of something or other somewhere based on an experiment that had blocks, a model, blocks of parts, and then an area where people had to build, you know, replicate the model. Just one person at a time, of course, but it did  involved eye movements and monitoring where they're looking compared to the hand movements. Oh yeah, who was that then? Ballard. Back in 92. Are they still on the business? Yes, I think so. Where are they? I'll not sure. Okay. Well, they might have the focus on the complexity, right? Yeah. I need to use that that long ago. So they're still working around.  Is it a paper you can get? That's what I'll have to train find out. Well, they still do a tree library loans and stuff. So if not, the national library has been heard. So do we think next week, that's what we're going to talk about? Because we don't want to ask Ellen I had a time if she wants to come along for a discussion about. Just not here next week anyway. Oh, that's  It's next. Wait until you're thirsty before she's back. Okay. Oh yeah, she, her stuff was getting blocked off the mailing list because she's not mailing from her normal account. Oh, is that what? Yeah, she's got a Yahoo again or something. Yeah, forward. And I can't figure out any way to just approve messages from her without subscribing at that account. So. Oh, well, it's a thing something been getting through.  It didn't say much.  So I'll double check the DDS specification against that. Just make sure it's got everything you say you need. Well, I don't think that list is our final word on things. But I added things to it. Oh, well, I don't know when you last looked at it. But when I added it, it was something in the last two weeks. I don't think I was probably paying attention to the paper. I mean, I'm not going to have use on this anyway. What I'm really worried about is making sure that there's no big surprises for Ellen and JP.  you know when they suddenly discover that there are some analysis in there and we didn't put it in. You know because now is the time for there has to be figuring out what we want out of that data and getting you right this stuff or getting JP to write the one-dimensional analysis that he was talking about. Yeah, yeah, because we got all of it and the ASCII format at the moment and just to matter what data we need to pull out of that into the GDF so it can actually do the proper analysis. Because I think all the analysis is going to be run off the GDF format.  Because we decided that if we look at the dynamic regions and whatever it has to dynamic regions that I think might cause a bit of trouble Yeah, which is yeah, which is why we have to do it off the GDF as opposed to the EDF format So all right, okay, so actually you're breaking this down into two steps now one is just a straight extraction from the ASCII and the other one is any post analysis that that adds information by Analyzing it. Is that yeah, yeah, so this is GDF it's got  Yeah, so it's got the stuff on the EDF such as the ASCII Fold and things like the mouse movements and things like that. Yeah, it's something that's got shops through the eyesrack. Yeah, and then on top of that, the GDF can also have information such as, at this point in time, they were looking at the new parts area or they were looking at the target. Okay, that is post analysis. Yeah, so, yeah, so the idea is the GDF is going to have that sort of information in it. And then also because it's XML file, we can then do XSLT or whatever onto it to get extract whatever bits of data you need for.  Yeah, for whatever it's about. It's a surgery for it. So. Oh, well, that all sounds good. So I've got one thing to check and one person to ask a show volunteer to be ahead. And as far as I know, that's it for me. So yeah, I'm explaining something. For one of my other things, there's now a specific woody page that says stuff gene has to do at a beginning to pick up. This is quite a good idea because I'm  about that during the stuff people expected me much more than the other way around right? I think according to the latest documentation you're down for five percent of your 15 months on this project or something. What documentation? Some uh, JASTER port. Oh, officially. Well, it doesn't actually make its way into my salary.  I'm going to give you a good time talking to you guys. So you're getting something out of me.  I have to just, you know, let work it. Keep your breath ready, good job.  I'm not going to measure it.  I'm just worried about this one because it's amazing how much sand is small to your own can shift. So you know, in the UK you don't go on sand because there won't be sanding stuff. There doesn't seem to be quite so many people there. But you still have thought that they're really feeling like sanding on top. But unless they come out of the...  We did the very first thing. So it's just the French countryside. We haven't had anything except wine and he had ducks. What do you do? I think the duck is so. So I expected wine and cheese as well. Oh, don't cheese. And I forgot to eat it for the royal. But well, I'm going to eat the bottle and the limes.  But first, you know, markets open in the morning, everything closes between the phone and three. No sense of doing anything. Which seems to be the market that I prepared some nice meal. And that's it around. It's a place in Badman. I don't know what it says.  I'm looking for a lot of people to play.  Okay.  This one was present.  I mean if you were late because of that it's not. I'll find a way around it. And I've put you guys on Mondays at this time for my convenience but it's not like it's important. Yeah well I was just basically getting out of it when I did make it in time but it's just because of the leaves and things and the trains weren't stopping at the stations. So it's like the speech restrictions on. You're just sliding past. You're really? Yeah. Great. So what they have to do back up? I'm not sure. The then the busing people in this case station have particularly problems  There's something else on the hill or something. So it has to have the bus people in from like, say today the same. Master. Yes. But yeah, at least it was speed restrictions instead of like train the flying pass into barriers and things. Yeah, we're glad they look after that bit. Oh, yeah.  I don't know, do we want to look at anything? It's not up yet. I can skip it. I'm just doing it. I don't know what it's doing. Oops, that fell off. Doesn't like silk. Stay.  Now we're going to discover we've got no reason to meet, right? Because everything's going swimmingly. Is everything going swimmingly? Well, you know, I've got a problem or a problem from waiting for the get contagious, so I don't. Because I haven't been, I haven't read the wikis in my email since I left. So. Yeah, I haven't added anything to the wiki recently. So I've been working on trying to get the XML stuff working. So basically learning how to, how the DOM works. So I can do  the next, so I can generate the DDF files. Oh yeah. So, so yeah, so just to just to read the documentation that was doing in last week, just so I know how it all works and the very thing and the best way to do things. But at the moment I've been playing about the dumb stuff in Mozilla, because it's just so I can see how it works with the HTML pages. So I can generate the X-ray X-H-ML stuff and see how it all works there. This was much used to just see how things work in that.  I don't know the Mozilla stuff so if it turns out that it's idiosyncratic in some way that teaches you funny habits Then it won't have been a good idea. Well, the API is standardized by the W3C so the API is stand between everything Well, there are certain companies that I don't want to name. We can't always get it right Yeah, Mozilla. Yeah, it'll be all right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just I believe you know. It's a good strategy. Yeah. Yeah, well, yeah  It does like me and say this is a misedir or any feature and things like that. So I've been avoiding those anyway. It's just that that's that's quite quick way to just to get into how the how it works because I can just quickly generate a web page and then just add in. Yeah, add things to take things away and see exactly what's going on at the time. So what why does it help to the sex team? Each email instead of just XML. Just because X H to have a nice, you know, that you got browsers there so you can actually see you can actually see directly what's going on.  you put an XML file up and it'll just apply some default styles you to it anyway that shows you. Yeah, well I'm using XH Gmail. All the web pages are XH Gmail, so XML just with the HTML, DDD. Okay, yeah. Yeah, just because you haven't quite finalized the GDF format. So just, just, just, just. Okay, so what you're gonna have to do is swap in tag names later. Yeah, yeah, so all I have to do is change that sort of thing. So it's, yeah.  I'm trying to think of the things that could go wrong. But since I haven't tried it this particular way, you know. But yeah, that sounds good. So you say we haven't finalized what the GDF looks like. Is that an implicit request for me to do something? Or? No, well, what I'm doing around, I'm looking through these stuff that's drawing from the wiki to say what we need in there.  in the output format for the task. What you're going to do the analysis on. So I'm making sure that I can take that information out of the DDF as it's as a state at the moment. If I find something that you can't get out of it, then I can add that to the DDF format. Yeah. As well, I mean, there's two cases in here, right? There's things you can get straight off the original format. And then there's things you have to do some kind of post processing of the original format. But it's not just a data format change. It's actually some kind of computational process to get the thing out of it as well, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,  So we're going to actively on this analysis things are you just working on the translation. Well I'm trying to make sure that the DDA form what we've got in the moment, well output, they, well I've got an older analysis that Robin's looking for. So I'm using it as a way to get into using the DOM things as well. So yeah, at the moment I'm looking at actually the DDA form itself and then to generate the DDA form that I'm going to be taking stuff out of the Jest Analyzer and then using the DOM parser to generate  the  control when you're happy and you guys are telling each other what you guys need to know. So I don't need to do anything, right? Nope. You're all fine. But there was a number of things that came before this, right? It sounds like they're not under control yet. So you know, the GDF stuff, the Ellen's view on this is we go through everything in order. Like the priority is exactly the pipeline order. Yeah. So, Camtasia, you mentioned. Yeah. And I'm not sure what else, but we should check what other things were before this on the list of things to do.  Yeah, yeah, I think the thing I've got left to leave before the experience of me run is get the check-in data works Now go to countries running on machines, and I think this up correctly But I can't test it until we get the microphones working until you get the microphones Oh microphones batteries we're waiting for batteries here. You I was told the beginning this week Okay, are they really really strange batteries? They are quite strange have you tried mapplin?  It's, um, Avril has ordered them from some parts. I've got some. Probably. No, no. About one fifty each or something like that. Cause you know, like we bust your neighborhood of Apple and might solve the problem if it's getting in the way. Uh, well, hopefully they should have been here last week, but Caroline then phoned up to chase them and they were told to be here. Should be today. So this isn't actually, um, ruining your schedule for anything. And that's why you're waiting.  Well, we can still test whether Camtasia runs anyway. It's just the whether it's the microphones are picking up things correctly. Right. Okay. It's it sounds like you're not actually worried about the fact that this is. Not yet. Yeah. When you get worried, go to Mapplin. Okay. Phone them first to make sure that they're in there. Somebody around must have a police Steve. Somebody in the techy group will have a map on catalog. I'll see if I can them. It's useful to know who's got a current one anyway.  I don't seem to get them anymore. I guess they don't buy enough equipment. All the most of some line these days anyways. Oh yeah, of course. Duck. So you can find out whether they have it. But you'd have to phone or define it if they haven't been stopped on that. I actually live not that far from there. So it would be half hour diversion  from my morning routine to pick up stuff. But then again it's still so very close to hey Morgan. Yeah. So it's even less of a diversion for you probably except you don't know your way around. I can easily get to Matt. I don't worry. I usually miss her. I usually wear a amigig. I know I know I'm out for this. Yeah. I just think well you know for the sake of three-quitter however many quitter how many better is this thing take? Doesn't take  100, no it's two batteries we need. Yeah, then you know put your mind at rest. You know you wouldn't want it to be the morning you were supposed to be recording. You know this. I could give you a call in the way in tomorrow and if not, not paid in your pigeonhole lock needs you got off the train and just pick them up from there. Yeah, check they got them first though. The stocks are a bit funny down there. Right. Yeah, well I'll make them make sure I've got the phone number in my phone.  Because you know it's not that attractive an area to walk through if you're not gonna get in the corner of the fence.  change my password. But you guys probably know off the top of your head, is there anything else that we were waiting on before you could run? I remember the week. So all those tasks, I think this holding me slightly up is checking whether it was finished, there is a working.  model builder, but I'm not sure if it's a finished finished version yet. And his last day was the 31st of October. Yeah, he still had hours left, I wasn't sure if it was dang to the number of hours or were there 31st of October? Yeah, it's hours. Yeah, it's hours. So he's got hours left. He's behind hand. I think he was billing for he was billing for the hour. So I thought, well, I mean, obviously if he wants to finish off then, you know,  I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I... I...  a lot of dirt right so you use expert to make the parts and then you well we don't need to make the parts or all the standard 10 gram ones before anyway the other thing is only when we come to building earplains and you peculiar shapes but for this experiment it's just a 10 gram type yeah task okay I have something in my email about from Joe he wouldn't have sent it just to me would he do you have any check that  I'm not gonna project my email. Absolutely. The nothing perdain thing from you for a week or so anyway. Okay, I think I might have heard Thursday or something. I can't remember exactly what it was. That's newer than...  It's the last thing was in response to the thing I was seeing last week about the parallel ground being the wrong way around from the model. Yeah, yeah, that's also a green shot. Yeah. That nothing has I heard anything since from either the Netherlands or from you. Okay, so I've got something on the 28th that's Friday. I think. Oh, you just want to know how to get paid.  Right, that's just he's done done done. Anyway, he's in Adam's breast. So well, I suppose he won't come back as Kirk's end is desk. It was he back? Yeah. Right. So... I'm using dice machine. So he falls to pop in for five minutes. The windows machines free from at the moment. Oh, he's just not gonna try to squat there. That's all.  19th October that said he uploaded some changes that you wanted that's Oh, see you didn't get that it was just me and him but presumably he put it on the wiki so So he's just telling us because he thinks we probably don't read wikis And I'll just check it was after that it was the thing about By the parallel of a gram was the was a mirror image  I'll continue on with you, I'll continue on with you. I think it's got something to do saying that he'd updated the whatever it was on the wiki. So he'd uploaded a new zip file, never written the old one. Well, I haven't replied to him about, yeah, I really don't have anything more recent from him. I haven't replied to him about, you know, how to submit costs and stuff like that. But that suggests he's at the end of things, but we could just ask  I mean maybe you guys would just want to ask them directly you're done done right because It's with you guys knowing and then of course any problems that remain you inherit Yeah, but you know it's worth taking a look at what it does and making sure it does what you want I guess so the problem is you want you wanted to construct some models and it for you experiment But you open to get some from their loose. Yes, or at least she was meant to have some idea of the level of complexity because the the have actually run  and to like an idea of the sort of style and to check the BOR right. All very quiet. Right. Have you tried cold calling her? That's what I do when I need things that. No, it has just been email rather than a telephone type of affair. Oh, the trash down. If you get him today, when are you going to start running?  I'm down for a week, what's the seventh? It's a week to date. Oh, right. So you have to be ready, then? We're a group, technically. We're a group, technically, and everything. But that's when I'm hoping. Right. OK. We have been, of course, put back a bit by the eye tracker going down. Uh-huh. Yeah. Makes sense. Yeah. But sometimes we're needing, we're certainly needing some data in the bag.  by the first of December I think. Yeah, so you don't have subjects lined up but you don't expect any trouble getting them. Hopefully not. The only other slight complication is which I think brought up at the meeting on Thursday for all the eye tracking users. Yeah. The lab has been block booted again. Bye. Jules from  I'm so called you. I don't know this person. So they, well, they need to be serious about it. Who's there? Is that a staff member or a student? Okay. Well, we kind of paid for the lab. So it depends. But I suppose talking to them sometimes solves these problems. You might. It depends on what sort of staff members is a. Lake Chitter. Right.  I mean presumably he or she is not running subjects the entire well presumably not but this sort of book for how long for certainly 60s for 10 to 5 for two or three of those days so Ellen still had a town right it's just you could try calling this person and see how this works Ellen might be  I'm not persuasive. It's just sometimes academic staff have a bit of a chip about research staff. And since I don't know the person, I can't tell whether it's one of those or not. I wouldn't. I can probably at least email her and ask her if she's really leaving it all that time. Yeah, and then ask her late, I guess. But you know, or whether they can be put off for a little bit or something. So I have no idea how the book  system works. Well, you're discussing it on Thursday, right? Well, yeah. At the moment, there's just a booking system. Yeah. Yeah. People just, if they can log on to it, can book it. Yep. Well, that's, that's one to raise at the meeting. I might talk to Ellen about that ahead of time because they may have, she and Martin may have had discussions about appropriate use of the lab. In theory, Jases made to have it every morning. Oh, really? Yeah, but don't you guys set up for, isn't it block booking more  appropriate because isn't there setup involved in changing around for somebody else? There shouldn't be any changes in the physical connection. No or in the software or anything. No. Okay. So there's no cost associated with it being mornings or afternoons. No. As long as other people don't for some reason, I don't know, disconnect.  So in the worst case, you may be able to make an argument if you actually need that week that you can collect in the mornings that week. Is this something that's known outside Ellen's hedge? Yes, it's on the booking system. It's on a web page at Frank Created, a big lab. But you don't know if anybody actually knows is there.  So it sounds like you've got a lot of possible ways of getting what time you need. Of course, try to be kind to other people. But you would anyway. So those are the only things that are worrying you. Camtasia and Lab Access. And otherwise, no sweat. You're happy. I've also got to get Ken Tsea. A lot of builders here. Well, yes, the motor will have to get Ken Tsea.  working as a sort of little multimedia thing to generate a video of how to sort of an instructional video. Oh yeah. Uh oh. This is going to take a little while. Let's do this week. Well, well, no, hopefully once I want to go around and try to give you some screenshots to work with and then just be a matter of adding your video, makes movements or whatever. So. Yeah, but you were going to try and figure out how to overlay something on top of the video that  Or no, you were just really gonna run a video of the trial. Yeah, that's that's much easier So with the model builder, what do you need to do with it? Which one may use gonna look at what it does so far and I'll just have a look if you're anything problem with it Things are lucky page up for that for that piece of that thing So it would just put whatever recommendations bugs on that page and all work through them  I can't hopefully there's no problem. I see Martin Lewis was also meant to be checking it and doing things. How many models were you relying on her for? So are you suddenly going to be? It hasn't been divided up. Well, what I'm trying to get at is is your start time going to be delayed because you don't have the models ready if she doesn't come through?  Maybe how long it takes me to generate them or how I get on with the Camtasia. Oh, yeah Well, I'm sure of yet Can you draft Craig in to build some if necessary? Yeah, I'm not sure if you use the software in this last not that hard on it shouldn't this shouldn't be any great problem. It's just checking that there are a suitable level of complexity  Yeah, I want to imagine the building, the model is going to be that hard, and these are just, well, how many thousand there are on that Dutch website you found. Just, you know, pick some of them, read either of them in the J.S.E.D. format. That's, yeah, it's a pretty mechanical like, and these are, they need to do that. So, that's a matter of choosing which ones you need to do. Yeah. Which I guess you have to do.  Yeah, you're my legs need to. Yeah, exactly. You can call a just tell gun between you and Marluse. You know, if it's not that see, you know, with a cold calling, you can usually at least find out whether they're alive and get an offer to get something. But you know, the next the next escalation is saying, no, we really need to talk about this. We're going to talk about it, you know, Tuesday, such as time, unless you. Yeah, it's a good time. All right. I'll try and get  for presumably whatever it is they've been going through is now over I think it it was up till the end of a two person presumably today they're now free or we go to recover I just hate for that to to slow you up and collecting stuff that's all well hopefully it won't anyway it's just if I then do it I hope really we'll get the right models yeah that's okay that's the brook so it won't get it's whether the models are off the  That's quite a small thing she can do for you, I guess. You know, it's not like, you know, sitting there brain deadly, constructing, you know, some models that she needs to do, it's just provide advice about this, which must take less time. Well, that all sounds fine. You guys worried about it? You worried about anything. We mostly have been talking about the experiment schedule, so. I don't think so. So the major thing I've got today is get this Camtasia sorted out. So just wait for the batteries for that.  I'm not worried. I'm not worried. You're going to run out of things to do that we haven't set you up for any time soon. The PDF sounds like it might take a wee while. Yeah, because I've got to finalize that format. And then once that's done, I'll get a start looking at the analysis side of it. And that's all the dynamic region part of it. Yeah. But you don't need anything for me for that because that's already sort of spec. I mean, again, that's the per view. Yeah, I think the analysis will take a little while.  I don't think it's going to take that long to get this stuff sorted out. It's going to be had to display it and all that sort of stuff. Whatever makes it easy for you to do.  and when the experiment is running, it's alb in the lab. Yeah, because he might. I can't just go in and let them get in. Oh yeah, no, no, I understood that. It was a people plan. But it was more like, you know, so this week he's got the GDS stuff to do, then next week you're planning on recording and what happens if suddenly you're unavailable all of next week, just 20 runs out of work. It'll certainly be time for now because I'm right next to the lab, anyway you'll come back just to check my annual and things in here.  Yeah, so what were you about then? Yeah, so I've also got to work on the Jazz Analyzer and turn that into a GDF outputter. And yeah, I can have a look at the Model Builder as well. Yeah. Good one thing I think about is, we're looking at the part building, part type stuff. And it might worth seeing if we can add a little part builder thing into the Model Builder. I'll just go tidy up from the code for generating the parts anyway, the JST parts. What a part builder.  Yeah, yeah, but I want to have a quick look at it and see how easy it is to add a cut of things to it because if I can use it to generate the Roxy Mangle for example and the rotation symmetry which of course in the bugs before So if I can use the model builder to automatically do that then that would say that would save quite a bit of work and save a few bugs Yeah, but now that the guy building these models know that they need to do the right some stuff do they have do you have trouble doing it? No, no, it's just something you got to remember once the part's being built so  Yeah, well I mean we might want to Severely cash limit the investment that you put into making a part builder. Yeah, well, not how many person days would it be worth like if Craig discovered it could be done in X days I Wouldn't bother more than one or two certainly right so there's a limit don't spend more than a day or two on it Yeah, you have to understand there's things about this project  We've hidden from you so far that you'll have to learn about it. Yeah. That's a little so something like a map task like for other Don't wait my task list. Oh really? Oh that will just be a little add on whatever it is. It'll be the same skills as you've flown for something else. And it'll just be I'm not even sure that you can see because I think somebody else is doing that actually. But I'm thinking more of the fact that at some point we should probably tell you about the S&X T stuff. Right. Yeah. Well that's that's just X will to that X and I'll take some L is not turning GDF. Oh yeah. Yeah.  into an exit.  I'll have plenty of questions for you once I get to that stage, I'm sure. Yeah, so just don't wither away, you know, weeks on for breweries when we got the real meat of this yet to come. Yeah, well fun plenty of really, really crucial things for you to do. Yeah, I do think you'll be truly a thumbs. Yeah, well, the way I think we're going to get camped out this week and it's concentrating on the just analysis of the GDF stuff. And then yeah, once once we're done that, whatever you want to  We do want to do the audio.  Oh, right. It's actually next week. It's actually the week that you were planning on. Okay. Well, I don't know. Anyway, you'll tell me whether we can tell this or whether I just talked to Craig. It was just because we won't be up here because we don't look like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a  I'm going to record two's. What else? Why are there other complications? Two weeks tomorrow I start my teaching. Oh yeah. Must be fun. Let's see. That's like four lectures and four labs. That comes at an ideal time for you then. That's like the 20th or something. I can't add.  I'm going to be over and oh you find that. Oh yeah you have to promise to tell us how that is. Because people do ask me.  Yeah, it's it's it's it's it's it's I'm sure most of our already know it's like by safety Yeah health safety that protection usual sort of stuff you get everywhere. You know, I think we're doing this Yeah, well if they were gonna do that then they'd push you go to it I would and I wouldn't know somebody would go on to know Nobody's pulled it super I'm pretty sure they didn't have induction in my day. So well I don't remember being asked for an induction. So really? But you always started here in April  There was supposed to, I'm sure.  person in the classroom.  position the second most position of the first most position of the second and I don't know I'll call them most action or something yeah that just in sort of So it'll be like in monitor but yeah, they'll all be different tiers like that and then there's the language stuff as well. Yes, that's just the I yeah, this is the stuff. Yeah, yeah, well eyes and mouse eyes and mice  And that's enough for you, right? Hopefully that's the way you want it. Yeah, it's just that slide. There's lots of things that can do that. It's the language part. Yeah. So it was just checking that I know the language part was a sales pay over this would be the new part. That seems fine. Do you know what the sets of codes are? Well, whatever you're getting out of the jazz  So, yeah, whatever that is. Blinks as well, right? Yes, I'm not sure we need to know exactly where they are, just how many there are in each. So you don't want to part of the state? I don't know. I think you should. Well, there's two views on this. If you do, then the people formulating research questions. We'll ask about them.  I'll probably ask them about them anyway and then you'll have to add them after the fact. Well, as you're just just shoveling. You can stick them in a different track and then load them or not load them as you please. Because it's not, well, I don't know. Is it part of, so these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive sets of codes against time, right? Isn't Blink a part of this? Blink would, at the moment, just get lumped in with the previous geese.  Yeah, but isn't that important? Because when they're blinking basically it's like a nil code. You can't find out what they're doing otherwise. So it may actually be important to have the blinks registered in there because you may discover you need to take them into account to smooth some kind of analysis that you're doing. So it could be that if only they hadn't had a blink just then, they would have been, I don't know what. Moving somewhere else or it's more likely to be  I'm thinking it seems the other person is doing something. But you want to know that. Not too much relies on missing stuff because people blink. I was thinking more like the person looks at a part and they've got a fixation before and after in the blink in the middle. And there may be times when you want to treat that as one thing. Normally,  We just as a add to the blink time and duration to the previous fixation. All right, okay. So but in that case, because you're not doing any new information, that's what the critical sort of deciding factor is. Right. Uh huh. In that case, then these tiers are already like blink corrected. Yes. Then you would have blinks as part of this. You'd want blinks as a separate tier if you're going to have an it would be as a separate  to your, where just the mark. Yeah. Yeah, chill position. Yeah, so the key thing is here is mutually exclusive and exhaustive. And the second key thing is it better be really clear to the people who are dealing with these codes. What's included? Yeah, whether any monkey businesses have been done around the blinks to correct for that. Because, you know, it wouldn't necessarily be obvious looking at that set of codes. No, no,  I think you're saying it comes out of the eye tracker already, right? They're already blank branded. Well, they're already the identified is blinks then it's it is a What stage the software I've used pools  And the blinks, so we'll add it on. I'm not sure what. Right. So that's the stuff that comes with the eye track. It's the other stuff that comes with the eye track. Yeah, so it's certainly it's listed as a separate event in the stream. Blinks are a tag from the EDF and that's everything. It's registered as a. Right. Okay. Well, if you want to, if you want the blinks to imagine to a fixation in my worth, making making an aircraft part of the requirement for the GDF stuff. So to remind me, so to just add that analysis.  to the answer to it. So, this is enough today, just checking the time. Because of the fixation, it'll be down to what we define as a gaze. So, basically, the time from when somebody starts looking at an object until they leave it. And so, if they blink a lot within that, they're still looking at that object. So, it's just the time in to the time out. But what we need to know is, like, at what stage in the eye tracking software, does that? And whether that gets through so  that Craig gets it automatically in what he's translating to GDF, whether he needs to redo the same analysis because something about the data path cuts off that analysis for the eye tracker, or whether we even like it, right? And want to do it some different way. Yeah, I think the ASCII format as it stands does contain blink information. Yes. Because I'm sure I'm sure that's a bit in the documentation I've read through. Yeah, there's a blink. Yeah, but it could be these things are corrected for blinks in this way. Plus, there's  So, you know, it's just a fixation around blinks and it also just happens to tell you where the blinks are. Because as you're saying, they like to use blink rate as measures of cognitive difficulty or something. So. Right, okay. Okay. Yeah, so my words are so much look at that and just to see what data is already in the SC format and whether you want me to do any correction as part of the analysis. Because I've got to do an analysis for their fixation on parts and things anyway. So, yeah, and I didn't  I think that you have a blinks during that isn't going to be a big problem.  the  So the fixation duration doesn't include the blink in the ASCII output. It's only when we start looking at sort of the total geese, total nighttime spain looking at one particular object, which includes all these sort of multiple fixations and any blinks and that sort of thing. Okay. Is it a composite viewing time? Right. So more complicated than I thought. I forgot about the multiple fixations on an object.  Okay.  information be taken fixation into cases and whatever else. Okay. Okay. Don't talk about that just a moment. Okay. I mean, this is kind of what we were talking about before. This confusion about what's in the GDF. I mean, you might see it as the initial GDF is just whatever straightforwardly translates without, you know, without transforms, but just the data format changing from the ASCII. And then there's a bunch of other things that get added that you might still want to be in augmented  the  I brought this up now. I'm not sure what point down the data path things sort of happen, but that's what I want out in the end. Yeah. So we actually doing much of the GDF. What are you expecting? Do you want to see an ass or something at the NXT? So when you're actually during your results? Well, the NXT stuff will have a more complete picture because it will include, combine all the linguists  Yeah, with all the movements and the actions, but they'll be I suppose just some purely I movement stuff we could do Yeah, well, yeah, you told me earlier because you could do a quick and out you could do a quick analysis on the DDF stuff without having to before you hit before you do the Dialoglances type stuff so you can get some some results anyway, can't you? Yeah, I mean it doesn't matter which data form that it's in NXT your GDF but it makes more sense for  the converter between GDF and NXT not to add any data, all it does is do this stupid data format conversion. And it's just, you know, separating it out into little steps. So, you know, there have to be these other scripts that add any data transforms, not data format transform, but data transforms like this idea of putting together data from fixations. So, you know, if we keep it simpler like that, so that it's in little pieces,  It'll be just easier to understand what the whole thing does. Right, okay. Because you know, suddenly you discover there's a problem with the GDF to NXT transform. You want to know whether it's one of these little post processes going wrong or whether it's just the thing that dumps it into the multiple files for the. And GDF to NXT transform is pretty simple. Right. And that's also why I sent you the sub-rookin software that the stuff that takes the ASCII  So format originally and then just the German stuff. Because that little utility does things like, well, you can tell it to what to do with blinks, where they're just the lumped or not. What the minimum fixation duration per stable fixation would be. So if it picks up to fixations less than say 50 milliseconds, you can tell it just to, again, lump them all together. That's not a reliable enough.  So that's a bit of software as saint and that includes the source group and things as well. So I'll tell you what, let's do whatever that source code and type of restrictions on that. So that's like all the analysis that you need to do to things. Are you just going to copy what they do? Or is it documented like why they did it the way they do? Or is it just? No, there's very little documentation that might seem for these things.  What's good starting point, right? So, it'd be interesting to see if you agree with the decisions they made about how to do things.  more look at this PDF stuff and start looking through that, start looking through that and make sure that works. So it also just filters it. There are a lot of strange event tags that the island could produce that are fairly meaningless. And it just strips out a lot with the junk. Yeah, yeah. But no, the jazz analyzing does quite a few of the things as well. Well, we don't want to build it into our data path. We just want to learn from it, I think, right? Correct.  for now. Possibly. But the same thing is that you use it for generally the stf stuff, like an easy incorporate whatever functions it takes from into Jestan Lighter when I'm doing the gdf stuff. Yeah, I'll just look in, you know, lucky. So this takes the ask you to a simplified asky and simplified in with transforms in it, asky. And it's just, it seems to me harder to maintain something that's got that in it, if we'd be better to break things up into like steps.  And then you know, as part of the, and I'll, well, why do I think this? I don't know, because it's somebody else's program and then they're going to give us the next version and that's going to break onto pipeline. Yeah, see what you mean. That's the main reason. Yeah, yeah, but what, yeah, let's say what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what I'm planning to do with it then is take that, take this software, find that what functions are useful for us in that, and then use those functions to generate the stuff that goes into the XML file. Yeah, I could imagine. I can imagine that also requiring some  discussion about what they do is what we actually want to do. That should be interesting. Yeah. Yeah. But the first part of that will be documenting what they've got and then discussing it with Robin. Well, that's not going to be quite grabable because it's written in Java. Right. But yeah, well, I'll throw my mostly here. I'll show you how much the logic is going to be. Yeah, well, yeah. And if in doubt, don't filter stuff out, keep it in, right? Because we always done the two.  other NXT track that we don't need to load necessarily. So on the FDA's you just keep stuff on us. Yeah. So he's better than making too much compression to start with and then being able to go back. Yeah. So those are some film execs and L NXT all handle it, will it? Oh yeah. And it's easy enough to dump stuff into a separate track. We got a teacher about this at some point though. So it's still like quite sure when. It sounds like maybe another week.  Okay, okay Jonathan made me promise not to tell you about it when you first arrived Quickly it's just too many things at once and it wasn't important that it be then Yeah, well, I'm gonna have you all the stuff over here been going through and it looks like it looks like I'm coming to the end of the stuff that's listed there already so I'm gonna start looking at that Okay, I think we're done  Right? Yep. Oh, my peach is blank still. Sorry? Oh, yeah. I don't know. I didn't really need to. This just says, look at the wiki. Find out what's next. He could give Craig more work to do. It's fine. I'm maybe checking maybe having to check out these batteries and things.  Well, we'll do with the trains as bad as today.  I'm not here  So we'll transfer it for a couple of years. We'll have so many of these mechanisms, sort of G, E, H, and X, L's to the same.  .  .  you  which data min, you know, yeah, I want everything and then I'll decide what I want. So this was that face to face meeting, okay. But it doesn't, there isn't, so there are things in the Attric or record that we definitely don't want in the GDF format like the frame rate I movement. You know, we're expecting the GDF format to be sort of a parsed version of  And you know, there's just too much raw frame frame rate stuff coming out of this. You wouldn't want it in this kind of format for translation to get back to it. Yeah. We're not throwing anything away. We're not throwing anything away. This is just I just took this at some finer. Yeah. Meck method. We'll still have the original and a method of. Yeah. But the way to think of this is this is the data that we want to be able to analyze against the other tribe.  So the data that we want to compare with the language or with whatever. And so as long as the format in which we pick it up is a format which could be generalized to a finite take because the worst thing that can ever happen to you is you discover that you've done huge amounts of analysis and you actually had the data but you threw it away because you treated it so grossly. Yeah, okay. So in essence, whatever we should be able to backtrack and say, okay, instead of every second.  every 10 to the second or some such thing. But what we're not doing frame rate at any frame for, well, maybe we are. I don't know. I had thought we were, yeah, the eye tracker does. But right, the kinds of events that we had before talked about putting into the record for then use in Alana and NXT isn't based on saying every X seconds something  You know give me what's happening every act seconds. It's more like you know give me the fixations and What needs to know the duration of these things right? Yeah, oh, yeah, it's not there's a difference between Saying that something is in a particular state every frame whatever the frame rate is you know 10 seconds a minute, you know that's that's one kind of way of looking at data and a parsed version of the data which isn't at any particular length It relies on this really close frame rate. Well, so there's no real time  There's only events. What I'm trying to figure out is whether we've thrown time away. No, no, the time is still in there, but you'll get what you want is to figure out what are the concepts behind that data that you want represented. So rather than saying the eye was at this particular place, you know, here in that a tenth of a second later here and then a tenth of a second later here, you say there was a fixation from this time to that time and there was a blank from this time to that time. So one of the formats in which a tracker data is analyzed  percentage of time spent on some target as opposed to some competitor over the first second after some event. Okay. So you actually have to be have to show at some time slice rate where the eye was on the same target as the other guy, a similar target what we've both been dealing, you know, so we have to we have all the parts, the interesting parts of the screen identified and be able to show distribution of gaze over time. All right. Now  We could be really unlucky and somebody would expect us to do that at the real frame rate. But I think that's really unlucky. But my point is that we mustn't throw away or lose the capacity of being able to deliver that kind of data. So there's two issues here. We're not throwing anything away. But the question is what tool would you use to get that information out of the data? Would you be... So the more you can plan... Typically the I will move. Right? So over any one second, the I's actually fixing a bunch of different things.  And so when you say the I was on this from here to here, what's gonna happen is that if you use the real frame rate, it's gonna jiggle all over the place. It's gonna be on this landmark. It's on this object, that object, this fixed thing, that fixed thing, okay? You gotta get lots and lots of stuff and it's percentage distribution that you're going to want. It's not, I went here, it's not like person walking, I went here, I stayed here. It's more like fly hovering. So you need to know the percentage of time it was on during that fixation.  Because if you take them as separate events, you get thousands of separate events. Yeah, but they start to name times. We'll give you that output. And then you just measure against, you know, I guess bigger frames. Yeah, the cumulative total timer. Okay, so the percentage is it's not something you're using for measurement. It's a cutoff for whether or not it counts as a fixation. Well, that's the problem. There are two ways of doing it. One is that there's always a cutoff, right? But the other is that there will be a  time span, a kind of reaction to some event span. Yes, a lag in some of it. I suppose there's the mechanic movement itself. Right. And so, I mean, there are really two ways of looking at this. One would like to know, for example, the percentage of time overall in which two people are looking at the same thing. Okay. And one would like to know sequences of they didn't look at the same thing and then they broke it or they did look at the same thing and then they did or didn't break, you know, one could imagine those two categories.  That's a kind of testing of our hypotheses, but there's a certain amount of Do's you pay to the way they do things in the literature to get your papers published and one of the things they will want to know is an event series after some critical event or percentage of time is given to looking where the other guy is looking and we're percentage of time over some you know reasonable time span of a couple of seconds, right? So they'll be they'll want to see essentially the gaze settling on particular incidents  on particular places. So we have to be able to deliver those two things and there were other different demands.  be able to basically get a scan path or the pattern of events from that. Okay. Can we try to make sure that this is satisfying out the search? Well, there's a whiteboard, right? We love this thing. See if the pens work. So this is A's eyes, right? And B's eyes. And I think what you're saying, you should probably draw this. Right? Is that they, you know, if from  This time, to this time, they're looking at triangle one. What you're saying is that you want to know in the critical, you want to know after they're looking at triangle one, what's happening in this period with the sky, right? Or how, let's imagine a typical construction event. There's some part, there are,  separate movable parts on the screen ready for use, right? There may be or not a construction already begun. Somebody makes the first move. There's some kind of communication either gestural imaginary or verbal that plans how we're going to do it. Before that happens, the person who speaks is going to do some kind of visual scanning. While they're speaking or communicating in some way, the other person may or may not be looking where they're looking,  Okay, they may be overlapping gaze at particular objects which are of interest. Let's call it the construct existing construct which could be zero. Or the the addendum the thing which is next going to be added next piece. Okay, now in neither case when you draw this he's looking at triangle one what you're actually drawing you know for the period of time in which he's steadily looking at triangle one is going to be very very short right because staring fixes  without interruption blink or or saccade is is in extremely short event at that point the love lumped all the individual fixations as long as it doesn't move off that triangle together is a toothless case case time so it's in a region yeah it's in a region that's a target okay but even so you're likely to get bouncing in and out of the region right so even so you want to look at if we're interested in how long before the construction  move takes place. How much of the time they spend looking at the same thing? Let's call that our measure of alignment. So they're going to be, yeah, that's right. A is going to be on triangle one and various other places. That's right. And B, okay. And we're going to look at the percentage of that time where they're both in the same region. Right. So what I want to make sure is that we don't simplify  I do know what I mean, temporarily simplify too much. It's so that, yeah, I mean, as long as we're, because then you lose percentage as there shouldn't be anything. It's tricky. Right. And so B has some periods of looking at one and all, which will also be intermittent because. Yeah. So, you know, he might get triangle one there and now maybe this one's going to overlook quite a bit. Yeah. So what you want to do is be able to define  bigger periods, which is the period when they're sort of interested in triangle one overall, right? This is sort of when they should be. We have an event that the second lane, then for the second before it, and then we can just take that chunk out and do something with it. Yeah. But that's that's okay. That's not something that you can do in the NXT query language, but you can't do that in any, you know, this is such a special purpose. But it's easy enough, given the data format for any of these things to do that. So you could do it on  because it's just a matter of the hard part is deciding how close together these have to be before you decide that this is a event that you want to pull out because algorithmically you're already putting together. I mean, this is essentially already these fixations with stuff in between. And we've got an algorithm for deciding when that's a look, I guess. You already have that or no?  or something that's crossing into that region. Oh yeah, yeah. So it's all fixations. These are all fixations in the cards, but within the, yeah. So that's easy enough. So the hard thing is they could be moving though I arbitrarily here, right? And you know, maybe even having fixations on other things? Yes, yeah, yes. Because for example, for part of that time, both B and A are probably looking at the construct. Okay, if your intention is to move the red triangle to sit on top of the thing already constructed,  you would tend to look back forward. Yep. So, and this is the able to, yeah. But what you're going to do is we can already build into this GDF format these regions if you can give a definition of what you think that is. But I think the right way to do this is to be able to inspect the data in some tool and play around with the definitions because you won't get it right the first time. Yeah sure. So the question would be under what tools  should we be looking at these events? And Elan's a reasonable choice for that, right? What you need is something, well, no, because you need to. You need to be able to see the effects of this. So I guess this is a case of Craig writing some scripts. So Robin having some ideas about what the relationship is and saying, you know, add this data automatically. I'm going to stop that hard, right? It's just there will be a bunch of these. You'll have  some rules about maybe how long you spend on other objects and whether the other object is the existing construction or not. Right. Right. So essentially this A-E is divided into TR1 and C and other stuff. Okay. Where C is the construct the existing thing. All right. So if they had a fixation on C, you wouldn't be worried. But if they had a session. Well, I mean, we take a separate, we'd look at  the percentage time. I have no idea because I don't know how people look when they're building things together. So there's the addendum and the existing construct. And I don't know whether they're going to spend more time looking at one or the other. But if there, whatever it is, that one is looking at the other's looking in the same place, they're in good shape. But yeah, they're going to look at the clock. Yeah, sure. I'm not going to look at the other stuff. And then look at the other stuff. That's what the diagonal stripes are for. That's true. But one of the things we'll be doing is  categorizing people I take it or interactions by the amount of time people spend looking at the clock. We expect that we put people under time pressure. They'll look at the clock a lot more. But that's like a separate analysis, right? Sure. It's a separate analysis, but you don't want to throw it away. Right. So every step behind, if all of these things are actually categorized by the eye tracker as to where the eye is, right? You should be able to pull out any interesting category and say, all right, for this phase, it's TR1 or C.  for this phase, it's SQ1 or C. But what we can get out of the data easily at the moment is at this kind of level. And then it's a case of defining algorithmically all these other transformations that you want. So this is one we hadn't thought of adding before, but we should, right? Which is, well, how would you decide whether something was the current addendum that you have to actually transcribe the thing or watch the film for a long time? So that's a human decision.  Yeah.  Yeah, well kind of assumption was that that this was JP land that that's what he was really what he was really interested in was the kind of coding which would define the building sequence okay, so and the And maybe he wants to think about that more and say well there were several candidates for the addendum All right, and and it was the negotiation of which candidate was going to be the right candidate. It's actually the interesting stuff. So I should talk to him about this. He's he's actually  He mailed me with a list of things he wants to discuss at length. So we believe JP defining that maybe. Well, this is my question for him. Is he going to define this kind of building sequence in a way that we can get out or see? So I mean, you know, they've been working on construction there for a while. So maybe that they have a coding system that's ready to go and we should just apply it. Yeah, okay. They do a lot of subassembly.  the tasks they've been doing so they may well have a I could believe them. Yeah, no taking an interest in that Let's find out I mean the general division was language here and other stuff there, right, right? So what well do we have actions might mostly be theirs right, but since we have the the eye tracker We're gonna have to answer their questions. Oh, yeah, I track her here. Yeah, we know that but so they'll they'll  So they'll tell us something about that. But presumably what you'd obviously hope is what happens here is what happens with transactions, right, that the verbal analysis and the visual analysis give you the same breaking points, the same chunking points. Well, yeah, but with transaction coding on some of the Mac, you wouldn't consider it verbal analysis exactly, it would be verbal plus action. Because, I mean, what, it's a task breakdown.  It is a task breakdown, but for the verbal version, there are ways of announcing that now we're doing a new one. You wouldn't do two coatings for task level. No, you would do a transaction code. One of the things you'd like to establish as an outcome of this is that you could analyze either end and you'd get the same chunking of the material. I don't think that's real estate because I think what you'd actually do is use the full record of what you have and do a segmentation. I think it'd be hard to understand  What  whether they stop it. Just based on the language. Because essentially you're looking at cycling, secantism, discourse. And if the discourse tells you what's going on, that's information. One of the questions is how the information is going to be shared across this media. And if you can get it all out of the speech, if all of the chunking is available when there is speech, then it's carrying a lot of the burden.  than the other things one could get out of this data. But it's possibly a look to data like this with our old-fashioned analyses. And it would be really nice to know that that much information, that chunking of the task information is being carried by the language. Because JP's question, the overriding question, is so what's language for? People are busy interacting all the time, and all of our colleagues don't even bother to control for whether people are talking to one another when they're doing these  tasks because it seems to them to be irrelevant because language is irrelevant. It would actually be nice to demonstrate that in a place where we're controlling whether you have language or not, you could get the entire chunking of the task out of the language. Yeah, well, I can see maybe wanting to know whether you can do the chunking just based on the actions without the language in cases where they use both. It's more, I can't quite see why it's important to know that they can do it just based on the language when you know that they have both. Because you know the self-contained system is opposed to a system which can't be interpreted without the other system.  I think you just found a fan almost all studies on language claim that language is a self-contained system which will give you everything you need to know. Really? That's the claim. Anyway, I didn't say it was true. That's the claim and so it's worth testing. So back to this main problem which is the record that we are getting in the first instance is about  these, you know, they're looking at some region of the screen to find dynamically. And then we need some way of knowing what the, you can, you can see adding these other analyses about, you know, they're, they're jointly focused on this region and trying to figure out what percentage of time they're looking at it as adding new tiers of information to either the Alon track or NXT. They're both sort of track based in this way. But the hard part is knowing how you want to do that. And I,  I think in the first instance, what we're trying to get into the GDF form, that is just this. And then we've got no option but to figure out a way for, like, to look at this, just explore this data, suggest ways about doing it, and be able to play them back and see when we think we've got these things right. I don't think we even know what the set of these things are that we want much less how to get on it. And we will, establishing the full set will take us much of the project. So yeah, that's right. So this is not,  This is something we're aiming for, but this isn't something that affects what Craig programs for the initial GDF translation. My only concern, as I said when I barged in, was just to make sure that we didn't lose the things that we might need to pick up later. So let's just return to this question of frame rate, because this is the thing we were not planning to transfer into this format. So, you know, a frame-right kind of coding is, can again be seen as a track, but it says everything's coded.  like this, right? Where you say it's on state A, state B, state C, state A. But since the definitions of look a thing we're looking at are the ones which get rid of the lower level, like jiggling around in the area of a particular object, right? So if we're moving the green triangle, we've defined a region which is dynamically the green triangle wherever it is. We will jiggle around in there, but it doesn't matter where we are in there. That's right.  So I'm just you're happy that it's not gonna have frame rate like this It's gonna have an interpretation like this well the that interpretation is Defineable to frame rate by our by the only way we're gonna use frame rate What does that mean? Sorry. Well, I mean because I can I can say for how many frames this fixation went is Officially defined so that as long as I it's long as it's not at untime-dvent Okay, well all events have a start time on the next time  So it's fine, I can say it's a long one or it's a short one or it's 20 millimeter more than that one. It seems to me that Alan's concerns might mean we need to add more information to these tags because this thing in itself is a bunch of fixations with the cards. So things like fixation, the number of fixations and the percentage of time those fixations cover you might want. Yeah, with some some measure of the so we could work out the number of fixations  that made and the average fixation duration as well, because having long steady fixation can be informative. So, a number of fixation as presented. This isn't a leading question. This is a question question. Why would that be informative particularly? If they're holding, if there's less dancing around, the cognitive focus tends to be in one sort of part. So, there is a difference between if they, even though they're still looking at the same time,  if they're looking around it and rather than just holding their gaze steady or on it. So you think that for example if they're looking at one or another apex of triangle, it would just make a difference that we're exploring the thing. As opposed to they were simply, all right, there it is. So that really means that we're not throwing away absolute fixations.  No, I wouldn't. They're through like screen location of absolute fixations. No, no, this is still summary data. We're talking about just adding attributes to these things that say the number of fixations that counted as that looking at triangle one. Right? So it's possible. So you so I thought I understood you to mean exploring figure because you know your fixation is a point and the figures are bigger  and points so you could be exploring the figure or you could be just somewhere in the region to find us the figure but not on it. Well, yes, but that probably isn't going to be easy to get against because they have to break up the part. So you just want to know the variability of the fixation. Wouldn't that differ from person to person? Yes, it can do, but it's also looking at it within the room and behavior.  number of different spots within that region where the I. We see just the number of fixations. The number of different. Yeah, the spots will be different. Anyways, okay, not going to have the same pixel. So we have the option that we can put in an a fixation thing here, right? As well, if you want the smaller if you want the smaller coding in here so that it's not just parsed into this idea of which object, but you also have the raw fixation data. We can put that in  as another track if you think that that's something that you might want to look at in one of these tools that shows you the tracks against each other. Well all I understood you to ask for was the duration. Yeah that's all he has for. Yeah well I think we've got everything then it's booze it's you can come back you can always see yes it's you're not throwing anything away then. Yeah and in NXT there's no cost right because you just don't choose to load those. All we're doing is dumping it as output that you can load if you choose to.  It's, you know, so if the things that you just know are crazy and you're not gonna want, then we don't do it. But otherwise we go ahead and dump them, because it's easy to dump out the fixations. Yeah. So it's a number of different fixations. Okay, so it's the number of fixations. Well, actually, do you want the average duration? Or do you want the number of different ones? Duration time as well, somehow, whether it's the average one or duration of each fixation in the region. Not eat. Well, if it's each, you have to break it down into another tier.  Right, you can't you can say there were three fixations and they averaged a certain time but you don't want to. The average should be all right to work. Well, what about the the overall sum of the durations? Is that I mean, which way do you want the number of fixations in the average time? Yeah, but that's that's the way you want it that way around. Yeah. So there's a little bit of jiggle in the region roughly. And did you want the percentage of time fixated as opposed to  Which is sort of another movie view of this number you can have as many of these should be you should be able to derive that presumably from well, it's not the extra cost of having these as attributes is not high so You know it saves you Having to do right scripts to do arithmetic on that later if you know that these are numbers that are gonna be useful to you What's our error of measurement on location on the screen?  to what degree do we actually know whether the two little eyes, little circles are exactly in the same place or just somewhere in the same region? It can vary a bit depending on the calibration. If we're building in a sort of error margin, we based on pixels around, but there'll also be a minimum one, because I'm trying to think that it's probably the small, the actual most icon is so small, it'll need a slightly larger, just because  It's yeah, okay, right so a larger area or a margin or anything Okay, so my question was going to be all right the mouse is a dynamic object, right the eye track is a dynamic object or is it only the the piece that the I track the other persons I track is on that's that's an object No, the the other persons geese is a is an object okay, which some with plus or minus something or other yeah around it some circular area  So you can be on the object but not on the other person's gaze. So there can be a triangle which has a gaze in the center and your gaze actually happens to be here. You're in the triangle region. Does this... But not looking at their individual. In fact, they probably will avoid looking directly  If they're looking directly at it, it's obscuring the part. But it's directly at it when these two, in this situation, when these two overlap. Right, like this. Yeah. That's going to, because the, don't worry about this, just, they don't look at one thing at times, or whether it's triangle or whatever else. But so what it just needs, they can be looking at the triangle and maybe a mouse point and maybe an eye at the same time. Okay. Well, it would come up, it would say, yes.  Right, I mean because they would be in the same place so if you you're gonna have dynamic regions which overlap one another by definition if the mouse is on the construct Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, well those are different tracks of information So what you want is one track of information about which object it's on what about whether or not it's on the other guys gaze and what about whether it's on one of the mouse we treat those as as other objects, but the difference between them and the parts of the  to be constructed is that they're allowed to overlap with other things nothing breaks. Okay, yeah but in the analysis you should treat those as completely separate tracks of information because they can be looking at they could look simultaneously at somebody's mouse somebody's gaze and some object. Right? Yes as opposed to simply looking at somebody's gaze when the mouse isn't also there. Right and you want to know those things. So these are independent, right? So they're independent on imicologists. So what we want is whether they're looking at  other person's gaze, right, and say they are in this period. Well, I mean, so a definition of we're all looking at it and touching the same thing. So imagine that we've just added a piece to the construct. All right. So now that's the construct and both most symbols are on it. Right. And both gazes are on it. Right. So at that point, you should have a lineup of A is on  on the construct, A is on the mouse, A is on, A is on, A is on, B is on, B is on, B is on, B is, and B like wise. Yeah, okay. So there's a lot of tracks here, right? Because, well, we just did it this fixation track. And then there's A's mouse, not their eyes, is on an object, right? And the mouse might be on here, but the mouse is also triangle one, dynamic object.  But it doesn't matter. But it's fine. The mouse, which thing, where is the mouse? It's on this object. And then, as I is on, well, as mouse, I guess, as I might be looking at as mouse here, as I might be looking at bees mouse here. I mean, these are all the different ways of taking cross products, the things that could be collocated. So you just treat them as independent.  from what you look for combinations of them. Yeah, I'm guessing from what you're saying you want all these tracks. I think we need to. Yeah, which is a measure of line that is looking where the other guy is directing attention and there are two measures of where the other guy is directing attention that you get from the visual track. One is where the mouse is the other is where the gaze is. So you kind of got the idea here? Yeah, yeah. So yeah, so it's just my writing. The two most pointless and the two gazes as extra objects. So yeah,  So the songs I've got an ID in there, we can just say right between these times they're looking at that logics or the different mouse, whatever. But the important thing is you don't treat the entire set as mutually exclusive and exhaustive. It's just, so the objects is like a separate level of analysis. It's one of the looking at the objects, then whether they're looking at the games. But it's also going to be the case that whatever region you define as the region of the dynamic object of the red triangle may get to the point where it overlaps  region of the dynamic object of the green square. Okay, what do we do about that? Does that happen? Yeah, because if you have them close together, there's always some fuzz factor around there. And so if they're left lying close together, or in the, in fact, in the model, in the, in the supplies set, they're actually neatly packed into a little space. Okay, so what you're saying is like a new problem for us, which is, you know, it's close together. Your eye gaze can actually be looking  the left age one and the right age of the other and therefore looking at two objects at once. Yeah, so you're saying Can you write on my pen pad just say yeah pens white boy pens So you're saying you know they could be looking at Square one at this point because they Because the two are so close together that their regions overlap. Okay, that's a problem  for the data models and either the things that we were using. And lace we just define it as there's only, they are exclusive and whichever area has the greatest overlap is what they're actually looking at. What do you mean by great research on that? Well, if you've got your sort of eye position and it's unlikely to be exactly 50% and one object 50% in the other. Draw it.  I think I'm seeing information. I have the one that uses the whiteboard because I actually put the whiteboard on. Yeah, well, I'm thing is if you've got, see, one object there. Yeah, so this is the better pen. Part one and part two. And you've got their sort of looking  There. Uh-huh. Then that overlap means they're looking at the two pieces simultaneously. Yeah. But you had a way of choosing which one, right? Yeah. But it just made me a bit as a new. There's more of it. Maybe a bad idea. You just throw a data away. Yeah. That's a decision word. Well, the thing is, I'm saying is, if they're looking, if most of what their overlap is here, then we stick with that one. So you just mean which,  Is it closer to the circle? I mean, what is the circle? They're looking at pixel or something, right? No, that because the geese position will be a sort of fuzzy area. It won't just be a pixel. It will be an actual like a circle. Well, an area. The geese will waffle. So that's going to be a circle point. It's a lump target. So they'll be a bit of a  So some sort of overlap. Or two objects. Or indeed they might be looking from one to another. Yeah, the guys decide what to choose or thinking. So you don't want to decide it's only one. The way the GDS forts is working at the moment is actually got separate for each part. Okay, well, that's fine. I was going to say that's the obvious. Oh, but that's going to be analytically because it's going to be yes or not. How many parts of it? Well, it depends on what you're building. There's different parts.  different parts of whether you do in the Tangram, where you do an airplane or whatever. Six to a dozen. Oh, I know ways of getting around that. Freech part. We can easily analyze it then later on. I mean, I think it's very likely that if the owner oscillating, then that's presumably going to change the weight. So you're actually going to see them flipping between the regions overlap. If they're really close through the challenge and get boxed.  And if you define the regions so neatly that we're losing gaze because of Jigal outside this closely defined region when it's in the middle of space, then I mean I actually like the solution however ugly it looks in terms of a data format of having a track for every data format. The way you do the analysis because you don't want to have to say, you know, did they jointly look at triangle one? Okay, did they jointly look at  at square one. Okay, did they do it? You know, you need some way of going over the whole thing. But we can find ways around that. I think for now we do it this way and then we think about what we need out of it in the end. It's just, you know, in a lot that has the side effect that if you go for the naturalist way of up translating to a lot, there would be a zillion tracks and it'll probably ruin their viewer because you'll get very sparse data on each track. It'll be likely to be for an expression general visualization  in the map task, when they talk about one landmark and then another one that was brilliant. Well, it's big, right? Yeah, it is big and you do have to scroll through it to see what's going on, but because you very clear picture what's going on. Well, we'll see if a long-like sitter and not. Yeah, well, okay, so we better do a test one. Yeah, and we better also like have in the representational list of part, like even in the NXT of translational list of parts. It affects the way we do the NXT. Yeah, but there's not really a list of parts in the GDF.  So yeah, that's not wrong. There's a base base of what I've got is, well, there's three places where you've got the ID there. So you've got an ID for a part, you can ID for a location on the screen. So that's just the target config, the clock, whatever else. And then we can easily add IDs for the two mouse points and the two gazes. And from that, basically all the tracks are doing is saying, at this, between this time, there's a look at this object. Yeah, this ID. So it's effectively a track for each ID. OK, so what about the point  point where a part becomes the construct. You still invite us apart. We know that we should lose that. Well what happens there is that the existing parts basically cease to exist and a new part with a new ID starts existing at the point where they're joined. So every time a part is added to the construct it becomes a new part. So the construct actually has say it has six things that are added to some initial thing.  So if there's just the initial thing you put in the middle of the screen, that's just the initial object. As soon as you put apart, there's a construct. But it's construct one. Because when you had another part, construct one ceases to exist and you get construct two. So actually defining all of those as the construct is going to be the trickiest thing. It's also going to be a problem because you're going to have one part to construct forming in the middle of a field.  Right, so it's not going to be quite as clear. Right, so you you're looking at triangle one right and it becomes constructors simply whatever Yeah, and there could be more than one construct at a time, right? It's a series of construct and you can start it can build something something like yeah, but why does it quite as construct one become construct two when you add something to it because the  Yeah, that's always working at the moment because it's generating any ID when you train new part. Yeah. Oh, and this is because we don't want it to stay triangle one. When you start with a construct, it's not a construct at all. It's just a one thing. And we don't want to triangle one to suddenly have the problem is that all of these things are popping out of existence. So do we know the difference between we broke it and it went away? And it's now part of the construct. Yeah, but there's join events. So if a join event, if there's a join event linked to LinkedIn,  you know it's become part of a construct. Can we tag the constructs with words in them? Yeah, the contrast is really tag with it. So that's actually a separate part of the day format which says for each construct which two parts made that construct. Okay, so we could essentially, well then we could cumulative or it is a new construct because it has a new list of new cumulative list of parts. Yeah, but you can still track what parts went into it. Right, so you can still find triangle one.  So some fancy programming is going to have to be done to say I was looking at triangle one and I'm looking at triangle one in construct one Yeah, but that's easy to me because the Ease construct has the IDs for the things that construct it so now we have to ask whether So let's imagine this we made a construct of two parts and we're Triangle in a  And we're considering now adding something on to the side of the square that isn't attached to the triangle. Are we looking at the square or are we looking at the construct? Yeah, that was the next question I had. Yeah. You'll be looking at the construct. In this definition, I should be looking at the construct. Yeah. There isn't a way to figure out that you're looking at the square rather than the triangle. Looking at the triangle. Well, yeah, well, we're thinking that we used to have the x-y traces from the  be  trying to run through in my head is that we can always tell the difference between something going out of existence because it's trying to construct something going out of existence because we threw it away. Right. Suppose we pick up and we screwed up the first time we put the triangle with the square and we threw it away decided we didn't like it. And we took another one. Is it triangle one? Is it triangle one prime or something like that? It's the replacement for triangle one. Yeah, if you try to.  It gets a new ID. So if you drag a new part, I'll pass back.  You don't know which one the men to replace but you know they're not meant to replace any that are all that are they haven't been thrown away the can't replace the new parts only appear when the previous one is broken Right, so the new parts are replacing those which have disappeared from the screen Yes, and there's no one TR one track the TR one track is gone. Oh, so there's no two parts with the same shape. Oh, they're many same shape but not the same shape and I don't know  Okay, so you can't tell what is meant to replace that because it's the same one. It's just case of the mold right? Yes, that's the way it works at the moment. I just assume that's how Nein Meghan had set up a lot. Okay, so that's back to Tim's. So shape plus color. They are individual.  So we hang on that makes the task a little bit easier. Right? Time, time grams are much easier and you can see all the lines. So it is just a construction task rather than a puzzle. Indeed, which kind of leaves you with an obvious way of making the same task harder and easier doesn't it? Yeah, but that's hard to code. I mean that's really a thing we might do. Okay, so now let's make sure that the  It's a beautiful controlled situation. The construction task is essentially the same. It's the figuring out stuff that gets harder if everything is purple. Just to choose a color at random here. Yeah, something that everything is growing, there's two triangles in the tangram. At the moment there are two small ones and two large triangles that are actually the same physical size and shape. At the moment there are different  that also means in the new parts list, they're therefore, you know, two large triangles and two small ones. Where is it in the revised edition? If they were all just black, there'd only be one mold in the new parts. When you specify these things, do you specify the molds or does it figure out what the molds are based on? So is this hard word in to Tim's program or is it just an artifact the way we...  generate the parts, the moles are just taking out of the files of generate the first place to parts. So have them any parts that are in the file that's how many parts appear in the parts box. If you have five black triangles and the parts box, but in the initial configuration you can reuse a triangle.  used create one black triangle in the parts box and then reuse that triangle five times in the configuration. Okay, as long as this is possible. So that just is a kind of thing which is so simple, so much like a single. Yep, same. One zero variable change that it did. But what was the rest of our exist? Because I'm trying to kind of map this onto biofix and biofix has multiples, has multiple, you know, all the  The nuts are red or all the flat things or... No, they can't have different nuts there. The same part, the same part is different colors. Yeah, but they don't have enough to make unique. No, I mean there's more than the multiple pieces of the same. So why? When you say red, nut or green, bolt or a long green,  I think we've got another point where, you know, to try to summarize, we think Tim's program can do both of these conditions that you want. But I'm still worried about what the effects are for analysis because you were aiming at something in the GDF format and I wasn't quite sure what. Okay, so I'm not sure what.  doing is kind of worrying about all the things that will happen that will miss by a simple view of, for example, regions and looking at triangle one. What is triangle one? So I'll stop. Okay, so I'll stop. But we said about that part that every time you cast off a new part from a mold or, you know, every black triangle has a different identity. And you know, it's a black triangle because you know which mold it came from. But you don't know which part it was intended to replace on the screen because you can't mind read.  true. So how can we define the shapes that people build? What do you mean define? Well, if assuming I was for a moment I was JP and I wanted to know how they actually went about building the thing. Okay, and I wanted to look at the strategy and I wanted to see if the strategy was different when we could talk about it.  And when we just picked up whatever, I mean, suppose I can't talk to you and I'm doing this task with you and I can't talk to you. The thing which is going to be hardest for me is making elaborate plans with you. I can reach for the next thing and you can go where I reach. But if I have some, you know, sub goal, some long term, sub goal of doing something clever with putting these together because it's hard and then putting these together because it's hard, it's going to be almost impossible to convey that to you. And the difference in the history of construction  Right is an important thing and I wonder how we can get that information back. I think that this is a human coding. That is part of the action coding because I don't see how anybody but a person watching this can guess why they cast off this thing at this time. Why is not that's not the question I'm asking the question I'm asking is what's the history of the construct so you have the names of the things in there and you have two constructs suppose we have two sub constructs and whichever one  How do you tell the difference between adding a piece to this first construct and creating a second construct?  to.  that  to do as a wild hypothesis more when they have verbal communication than when they don't. And we can do that by simply searching for any constructs that have constructs as children. Yeah. Yeah. So we can easily look at things like that automatically. It's just the why they get new parts that's the problem for us. We can't, if they suddenly, if they decide to get a part off a mold, we don't know. We can't know why. Not until they do something with it. If they haven't actually made a rule that you can't collect extra parts, right?  It's like gray diodes there, but they don't come filled. No, I mean you have to break one to get one. Yes, okay, you can but you can break one when you break one you don't cast off the mold yourself It happens automatically. Yes. Okay. Never mind it appears and then you So they just have to use it. Yeah, the new part lights up sort of thing. Oh But they have to drag it. I'll pass it  the mold line. Yes, you have to bring it into play. And you can't just bring extras in case you know screw up. You have to screw it. That first and then you bring it in. That is one thing unlike the say the bow fix or anything. Yeah, there's extra parts that there aren't any extra parts and at the moment the software doesn't. But it does have replacement. Replacement but new superfluous. So you can have a standard stock of extra parts that will never use. Okay. So this is why question doesn't even arise. So you appreciate  you appreciate the cost. Because you know what they're going to do with it. When they decide to move it past the mold line, they're doing something with it probably. And you'll know what they're going to do with it. Because, yeah, both of them are doing that. They must have already broken something. So you'll know what they were placing. So they rejected something and they broke something in it, perfectly. OK. Is there a way of telling the difference between intentional and intentional breakages?  How would you do that? Intentional in the sense that they break deliberately when they bring them into the new parts. It's like the trash can idea. They both put their hands on a construct because they don't like it. Yeah, but there'd be no way of coding that automatically. How could you possibly do that? You have to hope that there's language in one of them say something. But that's a human coding. Right. So that just doesn't be coded. There's no way you could tell that just from the...  So that's going to be a problem for JP, right? Remember all the things we're looking at are with language and without language and it's going to be very difficult to tell whether they broke something intentionally without the language, which means they start off with language and then they say, yeah. Okay. But this is probably part of the action coding. Sure. So I think that's the problem.  We just want to make sure they can wish list right wish list as a side effect. Yes, I'm trying to remember if the People deliberately break things by moving two pieces together They do they do if if if one if one person is dragging apart to part that isn't that the part that's just sitting on the screen does not mean touch they both break So the intentional thing is when they actually both click on the same object and  For sure you know that's or well, it's not just screw up But they could they could discuss to send it a break something I Don't never get away with that we'll get a bad score. Let's just throw that away and start again Yeah Wish reminds we have fixed the score problem. Have we? Yeah, yeah, because it was through the rotation. Yes, I  Yeah, so I yes rather than the number of penalties or something. No, the score was the percentage overlap and that made the score That's that's a week's work left but the problem was to do with the Which the had relative and absolute peace and it's all to symmetry But that's not a fight in fights. Yes, it wasn't it wasn't a bug It was don't tell me it was a feature  to find something that had already had it. Which is probably a documentation fault, right? It's in the documentation, but it's like, take that away down the final page. Not to prominently flag, okay. A communication flaw. Okay, so we can, that's now just lovely. Is there anything else you want to tell us about the prior part of this, which is the  You know, what else is holding you up from? Well, yeah, we should go back to beginning. The Camtasia was tested last week and initially we were a bit worried because in the old version it seemed to interfere with it. But when you when Craig recompiled it and it is new version, it seems to work fine. Right. So it doesn't slow it on the eye tracker. It doesn't do anything nasty. So nothing we can tell. So we pay for it. It's a very small graphical bugs, but it's not  is not a big thing. It's like color white pixels in the course of a task. So it's nothing but a distraction. Nothing big enough to look at it. So the last, I'm sorry, I had a sort of emails from you and I probably didn't catch everything. The problem was that there are two Camtasia records. Yes, they will now have to be two Camtasia records because each person actually sees a different screen because of the G. They don't see their own gaze.  Yeah, so there'll need to be two separate counties here. Oh, do you need two copies of Camtasia today now? Hopefully officially or... Yeah, the question is the license for Camtasia. You just need one editing thing and two recording things because yeah, the recording program is quite a small program that just generates the video.  I think so.  before we get going further. So this has implications for data storage, right? Because we've got, well, no, this is three times, right? Because we're gonna use just script to build the videos on the fly, right? Because it's fast. So the permanent storage is just the Camtasia stuff. So is that a problem? Where are we putting things? Is there such a thing as  You know dual track video because you can certainly mix things What ideally one wants one doesn't really want to have these things Because we're using them for backup and for coding. We don't know what we want to play independently We'd almost always want to use them in exactly in parallel time aligned You can tumble into one video frame if you don't mind losing resolution But that's maybe a problem right because well the other problem is Camtiz he has to be manually launched in booth  So the synchronization is going to be a problem. What are we doing for synchronization? During the task there is a flash in a bleep. Or not during the task before. Yeah, but we have to re-align them. We couldn't just dump them from their start points. Well, maybe you could. The thing that you're dumping them on to just starts running with flash and bleep. You turn on the two copies whenever at different times.  They're still, what do they, I don't really understand the parts that are operating here. Can videos are turning on? There is no time stamp that comes from some common source. No. They're on the two separate machines and you start and end them separately. They're not talking to each other. They're just recording. You start it recording and it starts recording what's in one screen and you start the other recording in the other machine.  These are backups, right? So the flash allows you to hand synchronize them later if you need to buy stripping extra video off the front. As long as you make sure you start them before the flash, then you're fine. But it will, there's a cost of having to go to backup, which is synchronizing them. So they'll include things like the eye tracker calibration. Yes. Which is not a bad thing actually. Because sometimes you want to go back and find out if this was just  particularly Duff subject. Yes, we don't have a one or two to the match. I learned the tick on to calibrate. Every time we calibrate it, I'm going to use the validation work. Okay, so you should start the Camtasia really early. Well, yeah, at the moment that that's why I was assuming. Right, okay. It's not actually saves you hours trying to make somebody's data smooth out when it won't because you go back and actually yes, the crap.  The other thing we were getting sorted out was the microphone. Because only one of the Camtasia videos will actually have the same track. And that's because we're just getting, we've got one cable and two mics. It's supposed to be... Well we need real sound recording, right?", "time": 188.75493383407593}
